She started her career with Galatta magazine, while simultaneously pursuing M.Sc Electonic Media at Anna University. She joined Silverscreen as a full-time journalist after her post-graduation and has climbed the ladder slowly and steadily. Her tenure as a Kollywood correspondent at Deccan Chronicle helped her gain contacts. Not just film news, she also dabbled across different beats contributing to Culture and City pages in Chennai Chronicle. In 2017, she joined India Today as a Writer. Having spent seven years in the media company, she is now a Senior Assistant Editor managing the desk (including Bollywood), while managing the Regional Cinema section. Training new joiners and overseeing the day-to-day activities of the Desk is her everyday routine. Apart from reviewing, she also interviews film talents and writes opinion pieces on movies.
