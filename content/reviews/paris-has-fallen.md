Paris Has Fallen is the first in the franchise that won't feature Gerard Butler's Secret Service agent Mike Banning. The actor will continue on with the character in the films; however, this spinoff series forges its own identity with new protagonists and a deadly plot in this European adventure. With only the first two episodes premiering so far, Paris Has Fallen has set up an interesting scenario in which the villain has had the upper hand; it remains to be seen how and when the 'fall' will come.

Vincent Taleb (Tewfik Jallab) is the protection officer to the French Minister of Defence (Nathan Willcocks). Attending an event at the British embassy in Paris, they are held hostage by Jacob Pearce (Sean Harris) and his men. There he meets an MI6 operative Zara Taylor (Ritu Arya), who helps him escape. Little do the duo realise that the first attack is only the beginning. Pearce, who was tortured and held in a Taliban jail, has returned to exact revenge on all the high-ranking officials who put him there. Thus begins the chase between Vincent, Zara, and Pearce's gang.

Written for television by Howard Overman, Paris Has Fallen has the basic ingredients of a satisfying action thriller. The stakes are high, the protagonists are willing to risk it all, and the antagonist doesn't intend to back down. In the intro to the series, we are already rooting for the villain (who has his reasons) over the government agents who are just doing their jobs. Fans of the franchise might miss Butler, who will return in the next film, Night Has Fallen. However, the events of the series, directed by Oded Ruskin, are enough to keep one invested.
