Despatch starts off as a journalist story. It’s 2012. Joy Bag (Manoj Bajpayee) is a veteran crime reporter for a Mumbai-based newspaper. Joy is in a joyless marriage with Shweta (Shahana Goswami), and he plans a future with Prerna (Arrchita Agarwaal), a colleague he’s been having an affair with; he is in search of his next big headline.

The journalist story slowly morphs into a journalism story. It’s 2012. A leading daily is on the brink of the digital news era. Desperate to keep the print flame burning, its veteran crime reporter chases a dangerous scoop. Despite multiple warnings and personal setbacks, he keeps going. Despatch then exposes and reveals itself at once: Joy Bag emerges as a fictional surrogate for J. Dey, the Mid-Day investigations editor who was murdered in broad daylight in 2011. Kanu Behl’s 150-minute drama almost unfolds as a prequel to Scoop, Hansal Mehta’s Netflix series that dramatises the life of Jigna Vora, the ‘rival’ journalist and prime suspect in the killing of J. Dey. It’s the sort of grueling double bill that captures the dying moments of press freedom in a country entering a post-truth age.
