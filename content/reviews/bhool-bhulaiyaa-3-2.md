Just like the earlier two Bhool Bhulaiyaa movies, kickstarted by Priyadarshan in 2007, the third of the horror comedy series by Director Anees Bazmee revolves around a phony psychic caught in the family drama of a haunted haveli. Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 opens like one of those The Mummy preludes unfolding a dark history from 200 years ago only to cut to the present, signalling at the wicked all the wrongdoing has unleashed, which Ruhaan aka Rooh Baba's (Kartik Aaryan) goofball ghostbuster must put an end to by hook or crook.

Here's what happens: A penniless royal family in Kolkata strong-arms the star scammer into rescuing them from Manjulika's wrath by fulfilling a priest's claims of good ol' purvajon ki bhavishyavani that insists Ruhaan's resemblance to their ancestral 'shehzada' is a case of reincarnation.
