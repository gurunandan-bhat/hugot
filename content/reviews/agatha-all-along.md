With WandaVision, creator Jac Schaeffer made it clear that she wasn’t interested in the standard approach to superhero fare. For most of its running, the Marvel TV show’s exploration of Wanda Maximoff’s grief over the loss of her partner Vision took the form of a sitcom spoof, one that barrelled through decades of the format—from black-and-white 4:3 aspect ratio to the meta recasting and costume choices—in an episodic fashion. Sure, Schaeffer struggled to usher her non-standard superhero show away from the climactic final-third tropes of the genre. But there was still a lot of fun to be had in WandaVision. It was the perfect possible start for Marvel’s new television-heavy era on Disney+ (though what has come after has been more miss than hit).

With Schaeffer returning to the Marvel fold for another nine-part miniseries, you would expect her to deliver something equally unique. Agatha All Along—which follows Kathryn Hahn’s witch character Agatha Harkness, who spent most of WandaVision disguised as nosy neighbour Agnes—does do that. As with its spiritual predecessor, it sets itself apart from the usual reluctant hero running from their past and saving the day heroics. Watching the first four episodes given to critics, there were moments where I had to remind myself that I was watching a product of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Agatha All Along is the furthest thing from Echo, The Marvels, Deadpool & Wolverine or even the second season of Loki.
