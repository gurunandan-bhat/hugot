The choice of using ‘Freedom At Midnight’, Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre’s account of the tumultuous build-up to India’s independence in August 1947, as the basis for the seven-part web series of the same name achieves one thing above all else: adapting from source material which has been in existence for several years, especially from the celebrity author duo who couldn’t be accused of being either pro-India, or pro-Pakistan, frees creator and director Nikkhil Advani of being accused similar bias.

Or, let’s say, it should. But revanchism hangs heavily in the air, and history is being revised and re-written, as we speak, so any interpretation is up for being challenged. The disclaimer adds, for good measure, that it has also been based on and ‘inspired by real-life events gathered through extensive research across credible public accounts, historic facts and news articles’.
