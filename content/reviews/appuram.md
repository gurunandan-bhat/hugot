_Appuram/The Other Side_ unfolds like flashcards, like shards of memory that Janaki
(Anagha Ravi) collects and rearranges in her mind. A series of Polaroids,
seemingly disconnected in time, each capturing a fleeting moment of joy or grief,
burned into the teenâ€™s psyche. At the core of the film is her mother, Chithra (Mini IG), who
was pulled towards self-harm and death by acute depression, even as the daughter and
her father, Venu (Jagadish), did everything in their power to keep her alive.
