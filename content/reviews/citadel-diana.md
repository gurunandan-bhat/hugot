Citadel Diana is one of the many spin-offs set around the American Citadel led by Priyanka Chopra. The series explores the world of a covet organisation across the globe trying to take down the world's most evil organisation Manticore. While Citadel carried the story more straightforward, Citadel vs Manticore, we get to see a different side in Diana. The Italian show led by Matilda De Angelis, Lorenzo Cervasio and Maurizio Lombardi explores more on the side of how things are done at Manticore. Released in Italian, with few dialogues in English, the show is expected to have a stronger opening than Citadel.

The show follows Matilda's Diana as the leading character, one of the best agents at Manticore. She is sent on a mission with one other agent to spy on other Manticore agents from France and German divisions. While they are asked not to intervene the mission does not go as planned leaving Diana wounded and her partner lost. Diana returns to the agency but is under interrogation for throwing off the mission, however, she has more to do. Diana never drops character but slowly begins to reveal her intentions behind her work at Manticore.
