Girls Will Be Girls is a quietly breathtaking film. It includes several remarkable debuts â€“ starting with writer-director Shuchi Talati. This is her first feature, and she weaves this coming-of-age story of 18-year-old Mira with tenderness, frankness and delicacy. Female teenage sexuality has rarely been captured with this sensitivity and nuance in an Indian film. Second, Preeti Panigrahi who plays Mira. Panigrahi is the find of the year. Without a trace of strain or drama, she captures the myriad emotions coursing through Mira as she discovers passion, sexuality, unbridled rage, a twisted sort of jealousy, resentment, disappointment and eventually, comfort. And third, Richa Chadha and Ali Fazal who debut as producers with their company Pushing Buttons Studios. Girls Will Be Girls does this with skill and uncommon grace.
