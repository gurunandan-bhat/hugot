Aman in red suede pants and jacket walks down a deserted road at night. Another man in a sky blue jacket over a black shirt races across a bridge as gunfire explodes around him. Yet another, in a deep blue shirt knotted at the waist, staggers out of a warehouse and is immediately carried off by a delirious crowd chanting his name.

Any Hindi cinema fan could read these descriptions and tell you they’re all the same man. Most could probably name the films as well &mdash; _Majboor_, _Sholay_, _Deewaar_. What would these fans make of a new film in which all these scenes appear in the space of 10 minutes?
