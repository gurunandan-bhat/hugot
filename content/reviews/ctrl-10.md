Well into CTRL, we know the film's protagonist only as Nella. While it’s certainly an Ananya Panday character name (past ones have been Tia, Tanya, Ahana and Bella), I did wonder if it was given by her Delhi Punjabi parents. But then we hear her father’s voice from offscreen calling: “Nalini”. And a little piece clicked into place: an assumed name, a username, a handle, in a film about unstable online identities.

Nella (Panday) and Joe (Vihaan Samrat) are a disgustingly lovey couple in Mumbai. They’re also hugely popular influencers, tossing every moment of their manicured lives online. For their fifth anniversary, Nella decides to surprise Joe at the restaurant she’s tracked his phone to—another personal milestone turned into viral content. And they do go viral, just not in the way she would’ve hoped. Joe is with a strange girl, Nella causes a massive scene, which is gleefully posted and shared and memed.
