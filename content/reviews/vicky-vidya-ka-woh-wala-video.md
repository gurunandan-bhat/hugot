Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video has the eagerness of a standup comic. It is the sort of movie that feels obliged to make a joke before a sentence, between a sentence and after a sentence. Problem is the humour is not just pedestrian, it's also plain unfunny. It's a joke, Manjot Singh in a cameo points out early on in Director Raaj Shaandilyaa's first comedy outside the Dream Girl franchise, as though embarrassingly aware of how unamusing the whole shtick is.

Shaandilyaa and his squad of writers -- Yusuf Ali Khan, Ishrat Khan and Rajan Agarwal -- waste no time in poking fun at senior citizens, Sardars, South Indians, Africans, people suffering from piles or speech impediments. Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video's onslaught of offensive in the guise of wit is either reinforcing disrespectful stereotypes or urging us to enjoy its relentless circus of cacophony. Too often though its threadbare plot behaves like a forcibly stretched elastic band shoving the sham down our throat for a staggering 152 minutes.
