More than two decades ago, Love Actually became the quintessential British Christmas film. The rom-com featured connected stories of love, family, and, of course, Christmas. Writer-director Richard Curtis's latest holiday offering is a family film, That Christmas, that follows the same template, but even with the mighty touch of Santa Claus, it can't recreate that one-of-a-kind feeling. However, for a younger audience, the craziness of the narrative might be just passable.
