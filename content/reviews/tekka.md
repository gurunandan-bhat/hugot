The film’s story is pretty much what you have seen in the trailer. For those who are uninitiated, here is the plot in brief. Iqlakh (Dev) loses his job, randomly kidnaps a young girl Avantika (Aameya) from her school, and takes her hostage. He demands to get his job back. Maya (Rukmini Maitra) from Kolkata Police comes to negotiate. Even after his company's maintenance manager (Anirban Bhattacharya) verbally promises to give his job back to him, he demands the owner of the firm Anubrata Adhikari (Paran Bandyopadhyay) to come personally. Meanwhile, in a turn of events, little Aratrika’s mother Ira (Swastika Mukherjee) hunts down Iqlakh’s house and takes hostage of his little boy.

After watching the film, one wonders about the logic behind the title. If, according to the film's creators, Tekka -- or the ace of a deck -- denotes the twist in the plot, then there is a problem. This doesn’t look like a well-played hand. Tekka has thrills and frills. It starts with a John Q-esque humane story of a hostage drama. By the end of the film, it also surprises the audience with unexpected twists and turns. What it lacks though, is a cohesive structure and persuasive storyline. Dev, Rukmini Maitra, and Swastika Mukherjee have put their best foot forward but even they are unable to salvage the sloppy execution of the plot.
