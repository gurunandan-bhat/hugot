Sometimes a certain space defines your identity and you donâ€™t know it until that space is
taken away from you. Indrani directed Bengali film Chhaad tells you about a school teacher,
a dormant artist Mitra/ Paoli Dam, who loves to spend her evenings on her building terrace. It
is here she befriends her niece and a few kids who come up to fly kites. She attends school in
the morning post her daily chores as a daughter-in-law of a joint family, Mitra looks forward
to watering the plants on the terrace of their dilapidated building.
