Perhaps Karan Johar, Alia Bhatt and director Vasan Bala, who co-writes with Debashish Irengbam, hope that nobody remembers Gumrah (1993), the Sanjay Dutt-Sridevi starrer which Mahesh Bhatt directed for Dharma Productions’ founder Yash Johar. In 1993, it was a besotted Sanjay Dutt who’d helped Sridevi break out of a Bangkok prison where she faced a death sentence after being framed by her boyfriend for drug trafficking. Bhatt had helped himself to the theme from the 1989 TV series Bangkok Hilton where an estranged father helps his daughter break out of a Bangkok prison in similar circumstances as Sridevi in Gumrah.

In 2024, Bhatt’s daughters (Shaheen too, as one of the producers) and Karan provide a platform for Vasan Bala to retell the same story with a twist. It’s older sister Satya (Alia Bhatt) who puts her life on the line to save Ankur (Vedang Raina) from an impregnable prison in a fictional country that closely resembles Thailand. Ever since they were kids, she’s been the protective sis, especially after they returned from school one day and saw their dad jump off the balcony. Apart from the gender switch where it’s a heroine to the rescue of a sibling, Vasan Bala also deviates from the boyfriend template and signs “Bade Papa” (Akashdeep), who brought up Satya-Ankur, as the culprit who puts Ankur in the dock to save his own son.
