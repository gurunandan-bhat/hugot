Invincible has been a fan-favourite show for years, and season 3 continues on the same track. Despite its popularity, the animated series still seems underrated as it brings a blend of gory but easy superhero genres. The makers struggle to balance the big picture and the street-level subplots, but season 3 ends on a powerful note. Steven Yeun's voice acting keeps the tension rising throughout the 8-episode season and is expected to get more intense with the next one. The season begins in the middle of Mark's aka Invincibles' character development, while for season 2 he struggled with his identity as a hero, the crisis remains in the forefront. After his fight with Amstrong, Mark is more worried about his own mentality and if he is turning into his father, but he keeps up his training with Cecil for months in prep for any Viltrumite attacks. Meanwhile, his responsibility towards his younger brother is keeping him moving forward. He continues to avoid Eve but eventually gives in and confesses his feelings for her.
