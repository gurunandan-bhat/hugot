If there exists a parallel world where losers are guaranteed to find salvation, Girish A.D’s characters would probably be the rulers of that world. Down and out protagonists have been a common factor in all his films till date, be it Thanneer Mathan Dinangal or Super Sharanya or Premalu. His latest outing I Am Kathalan is no different, but just as always, he brings the same underlying theme in a different packaging.

Cyber crime is the shiny wrapper that he uses this time around. Only that, we are seeing the film mostly from the perspective of the hacker, Vishnu (Naslen), who has completed his engineering course but has a load of back papers to pass. His lack of ambition and string of failures do not sit well with his girlfriend Shilpa (Anishma Anilkumar), who has joined her father (Dileesh Pothan)‘s finance firm as its IT head. When things go wrong between the couple, it triggers Vishnu’s criminal tendencies.
