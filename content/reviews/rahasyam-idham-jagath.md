How far would you go to help your loved ones? This question is oft explored in books and cinema. If done well, it can be an emotionally moving drama. Komal R Bharadwaj, who has written and directed the Telugu indie film Rahasyam Idham Jagath, gives this idea a different spin, interspersing elements of science fiction and mythology. There is romance, a bitter past, a possibility of revenge, unexplained murky happenings in an eerie setting and the possibility of time travel through a wormhole. It is an ambitious, interesting idea on paper but does not translate to an engrossing adventurous ride, despite the earnest execution of the film.

Rahasyam Idham Jagath unfolds entirely in the United States, in the vicinity of forests of Portland, Oregon. The story follows the journey of a young couple, Abhi (Rakesh Galebhe) and Akira (Sravanthi Prattipati), who decide to return to India following a personal loss, valuing family ties over their American dreams. Before they head home, they plan a brief vacation and are joined by their friends; but nothing goes as planned.
