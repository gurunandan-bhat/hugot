What happens when you take one of the most irreverent filmmakers of our times, and force him to be sombre, sincere and melodramatic? The result is a film like Gladiator II. It’s not to say that the sequel doesn’t have the campy goodness of the original, especially in the turns by Denzel Washington playing Macrinus (a gladiator-turned-influential figure in Rome), Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger playing Emperor twins Geta and Caracalla (a more sadistic version of Romulus and Remus), but there’s something amiss.

Gladiator (2000), starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen among others, fell into place around Crowe’s astounding central performance as Maximus Decimus Meridius — equal parts moving, thrilling, actor and star. Paul Mescal’s performance never quite lends gravitas to the sequel, and it might not have much to do with the actor himself, or even the written word. Something never quite clicks into place about Lucius (Mescal) and why he’s a protagonist worth rooting for.
