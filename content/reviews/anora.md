A lot of the splendour in Sean Baker’s Anora lies in its treatment – where we might be shown one thing, but deliberately made to feel something else. For example, the film opens with a discomfiting panning shot featuring barely-clothed exotic dancers performing with neon lights around them. However, Baker scores this scene with a loud, winsome techno song taking what is a distressing visual of young women forced to work a job that fetishises them, and drains the self-pity out of it.

It is what it is; these women aren’t victims, and Baker seems to be insisting we mustn’t see them with a patronising gaze, demoting them from a person to a social cause. They probably do need saving, but they have no delusions about expecting it from a drunk, seemingly kind spectator. They’ve probably heard too many 3 a. m. promises, which have been forgotten by 6 a.m. These hardened individuals hide their disappointments behind their profane, tough exterior. Ani (Mikey Madison) is no different.

In a sublime opening stretch, Baker (with indie films like Tangerine and Florida Project behind him) establishes Ani’s work day at her high-end Manhattan strip club. Her simple objective is to make the mostly male patrons spend as much money as they can, even if it includes detours to a nearby ATM. It starts off with some cute, flirty conversation to ease the patron in, and then somewhere along the way comes a suggestion for a private show. The action moves indoors, only for the spending and the bad decisions to quadruple. Baker is able to find a rhythm in Ani’s routine: in the way she dances, teases her clients, does what she’s expected to, and goes home when the night is over.
