Someone who loves exploring the intricate relationship between bodily functions and life’s larger purpose, after Piku and October, director Shoojit Sircar turns to a real-life cancer survivor to tell a middling tale of resilience and reform. A hot-shot marketing man, Arjun Sen’s (Abhishek Bachchan) career comes to a sudden halt when he is diagnosed with multiple malignancies. After initial bouts of denial, he doesn’t surrender to fate, refuses to become a statistic, and enlists himself in a long-drawn battle with the disease. Soon, we discover his relationships are not in the best of health either. At work, he is a cut-throat. At home, he is divorced and has a daughter (Pearle Dey/Ahilya Bamroo) to raise who suspects him of indulging in some sort of drama to evoke empathy. In the hospital, he comes up with diagrams and googled information lest his doctor (Jayant Kriplani) take him for a ride.

Arjun is no hero. In fact, it is hard not to dislike him but he is real for we find many around us or inside us. When the doctor removes a large part of his stomach, he describes himself as “gutless”. He indeed seems one for a while. After a poor prognosis, he turns his body into a project and starts employing his marketing skills to fix his organs and stitch a bond with his daughter Reya. Shoojit also takes on a similar task of making us feel for Arjun’s struggle but along the way, a truthful story starts feeling like a manipulative setup, ironically, a word Arjun abhors.
