Neeraj Pandeyâ€™s Sikandar Ka Muqaddar is a face-off between two stubborn men played by Jimmy Shergill and Avinash Tiwary, both of whom believe they are in the right. The Hindi feature goes back and forth between their perspectives, and as the story goes from 2008 to 2003 after a diamond heist remains unsolved. The writer-director tries to get us emotionally invested in this twisty tale of wills, but the nearly two-and-a-half-hour film drags out its premise.

The crime drama begins with the triggering diamond heist, which leads Investigating Officer Jaswinder Singh (Shergill) to suspect three individuals at the event. But 15 years later, the former star investigator's life is in shambles, but he remains convinced moolvriti (instincts) were correct. Avinash Tiwary's Sikandar Sharma, a computer technician, is one of the main accused who is put through the wringer by Jaswinder. The film continually tries to show viewers which one of these men will break first.
