For a long time, one believed that a compelling cinematic narrative shows more than it tells, and expresses more than it explains. However, the recent content spurt on OTT platforms seems bent on cerebrating the opposite. Do Patti is yet another addition to the long list of films that skip theatres for a streaming service. It reduces the art of storytelling to a mere artifice for meaningful cinema. These films end up delivering the message but little else.

A spiritual cousin of Seeta Aur Geeta and Darlings, Do Patti starts like a police procedural, forays into chick-lit, and ends like an essay on domestic abuse or a public display advertisement for the Bell Bajao campaign. Writer Kanika Dhillonâ€™s dialogues have more bite than her screenplay. Marked by an inconsistent tone, it feels patchy and too convenient to evoke deep empathy for characters in this mishmash of genres. Interestingly, for a film that picks the spirit of law over the word of law, it fails to make the same choice in the realm of cinema.
