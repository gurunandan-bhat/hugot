News is the truth that you choose to bring out, a cunning television journalist tells her artless subordinate early on in The Sabarmati Report. She's the villain of the piece for concealing inconvenient realities and conveying only what suits her purpose and politics. Funny how The Sabarmati Report's poorly crafted propaganda masquerading as a crusade for justice is nothing but a blatant embodiment of these very ideals.

Directed by Dheeraj Sarna (after he took over from its original director Ranjit Chandel over differences in creative vision), this is an embarrassing work of bias inspired by the horrific events of February 27, 2002 when a fire in a train compartment of the Sabarmati Express killed 59 kar sevaks returning from Ayodhya at the Godhra railway station in Gujarat.
