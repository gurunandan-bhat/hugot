Journalist-turned-director T. J. Gnanavel doesn’t seem to care much for any sort of filmmaking subtleties. It’s as though he enjoys dialling up the volume knob to underline his already-dramatic writing, and doesn’t let you rest until you feel the full weight of a scene’s emotions. This was obvious in the way he didn’t stop by just showing you a police officer dragging a beaten-up Manikandan K. into the back of a police jeep in Jai Bhim (2021).

He went a step further to then show a shot of a toy getting crushed under the jeep’s wheels to remind you that Manikandan was on his way to see his daughter and his newly-pregnant wife when this bit of police brutality took place.

Vettaiyan, too, operates on a similar pitch, maybe even louder, given the massier nature of its superstar’s fanbase. Not only are we pushed straight into a high-profile case involving drug-peddling bad guys in Kanyakumari, but we also get elaborate follow-ups involving pieces-to-camera to show you how society is reacting to each development. We get protests, TV debates, and a dozen reaction shots to make you feel the larger impact of the Superintendent of Police, Athiyan (Rajinikanth), and his trigger-happy police force.
