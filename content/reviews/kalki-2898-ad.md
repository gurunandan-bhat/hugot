It was 2015 when SS Rajamouli's 'Baahubali' was released and blew everyone's mind. To this day, the two 'Baahubali' films not only shattered box office records but also set a benchmark for films of the same ilk. Nealy a decade later, director Nag Ashwin, with monumental ambitions, gifted 'Kalki 2898 AD', set in a dystopian world. With futuristic ideas coupled with Hindu mythology, the film will surely blow your mind, just like 'Baahubali' did. Thousands of years after the Mahabharata war, Kashi became the last city of the world. And the world is ruled by Supreme Yaskin (Kamal Haasan), who is waiting for a magical serum to gain powers. The poor suffer in the city, while the rich enjoy their lives in the Complex, a place built for the privileged. It is Bhairava's (Prabhas) dream to make it to the Complex. He is a bounty hunter doing petty jobs to earn the units that will enable him to earn his place in the Complex.
