The final season of What If...? Season 3 highlights Marvel characters, big and small, in unexpected ways. Honouring both the comics and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it allowed the story to be taken further. Once more, Jeffrey Wright returns as the voice of The Watcher as he narrates these eight new stories from the multiverse, where characters from different worlds and times converge. While previous seasons were strong, this last season is a mixed bag. It starts off muddled and ends on a high note, leaving us wishing this season had a bit more substance. Each of the eight episodes of What If...? looks at an alternative universe where characters who wouldn't ordinarily meet are featured. And of course, the casual fan or newbie will be extremely lost, as the series requires you to do your homework (watch all the stuff) before enjoying this even more. Some of the stories explored here include the Hulk accidentally creating a gamma monster that the Mech Avengers must battle with, Agatha Harkness going Hollywood and meeting up with Bollywood star King, the Watcher disappearing, and the most bizarre of all, Howard the Duck having a baby with Darcy Lewis!
