Agneepath plays on the aircraft entertainment system, that telling scene of a young Vijay Dinanath Chauhan burning down a petrol pump being a visual allegory of a similar incident perpetrated by the protagonist in Jigra a few moments ago. This is just one instance. Throughout the runtime of Jigra, Amitabh Bachchan pops up as idea and inspiration, set-up and syntax. When Satya (Alia Bhatt), caught in a situation which may end in violence, is gently warned: "Abhi Bachchan nahin bann na hain... sirf bachke nikalna hain", she rolls up her sleeves and says matter-of-factly: "Ab toh Bachchan hi bann na hain".

If Bachchan, exactly five decades ago rose as the Angry Young Man, Jigra marks the arrival of the Angry Young Woman. Alia, petite and pocket-sized but packing in enough heart and horsepower, marks the adven of the fearless, fierce Bollywood heroine. One who doesn't need a man to prop her up or to help her, leave alone rescue her. She may be slightly bullheaded and mostly driven by emotion, but she has her eye on the target and she never wavers. She doesn't use her anger as an impediment, it simmers within her and becomes an angst-powered weapon, often leading to mass destruction.
