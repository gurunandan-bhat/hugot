In Bella Chowdhary’s world, there’s no such thing as too many bags and in a world of fakes, she is on a path to become a Birkin. But it’s a path that she hasn’t chosen for herself, rather, a tragedy has led her there.

Bella AKA Bae (Ananya Panday) was born with a golden spoon in a Delhi-based wealthy family. Upon the brink of losing their wealth, the family hacks Bae’s love story with a business tycoon Agastya Chowdhary (Vihaan Samat). But everything that glitters is not gold. She may have all the luxuries one can ever wish for, but none of them fulfilling enough to help her cope with her loneliness. Her world comes crashing down when a rather private moment becomes a public affair.
