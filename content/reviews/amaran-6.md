Towards the third act of Amaran, Major Mukund (Sivakarthikeyan)’s father asks him, “Why is Kashmir always in trouble?" This is a crucial moment, though it is shot with a matter-of-fact tone — reflecting the overall style of the movie. It is significant because it is the only time we gain insight into Mukund’s opinion about the politics behind the bloodshed and violence in one of the most volatile regions of the country. It’s essential to understand what a soldier thinks about the politics that have placed him in a situation where his own life is at risk.

Throughout the film, director Rajkumar Periasamy reveals the patriotic, romantic, and humanistic facets of Major Mukund, but his political views on the issue are never brought to the forefront. That’s why it is surprising when the question is met with a rather blunt, noncommittal answer. Major Mukund tells his father, “People who are supposed to talk don’t. What else shall we do?" This could be a critique of the ruling leaders of both countries or a commentary on the people of the state. The answer, like the movie, is not straightforward. However, what becomes clear is that Major Mukund is a soldier who will do what is right for his country, regardless of his personal opinions. In the end, if it is true that it’s not who one is underneath but what one does that defines him, then it doesn’t matter what Major Mukund thought. Amaran and director Rajkumar Periyasamy focus solely on what Mukund did, which is the ultimate sacrifice for his duty.
