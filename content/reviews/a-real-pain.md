Jesse Eisenberg's written and directed Oscar ready film A Real Pain has been released in India. Filled with humour, depths of human experience, trauma and moving on from it, it explores the story of two brothers from different walks of life. Led by Jesse as well as Kieran Culkin, the film is worthy of his international praise for its performances as well as the brilliant yet simple writing of the story and screenplay. A Real Pain begins with two cousins meeting at an airport to head on a trip together. The two, who hardly meet once or twice a year go on a journey together to honour their late grandmother, a survivor of the Holocaust. Billy and David decide to take a tour in Poland, visiting sights of historical significance during World War II and the Holocaust. Along with four others in the group and a tour guide, there is much talk about survivors, generational trauma, the struggle of immigrants and more.
