How does one lead a life when you forget your routine and even the mere existence of your loved ones? Bougainvillea, directed by Amal Neerad, is a film that revolves around a couple, Royce (Kunchacko Boban) and Reethu (Jyothirmayi), that gives you an insight into a pair that is trying to overcome this kind of an unusual situation. In the initial few seconds, we see Royce and Reethu meet with a nasty accident. The after-effect of the accident: Reethu suffers from Anterograde and Retrograde amnesia. Reethu's life is defined by Royce's ideas. Her day-to-day routine and details about her family are written in a diary. And house help Rema (Srinda) oversees her at home when Royce, a doctor, is at the hospital. One day, David Koshy (Fahadh Faasil) turns up at Reethu's home and asks her about the whereabouts of a missing girl. His interrogation hits a roadblock because of Reethu's memory. But, there's more than what meets the eye.
