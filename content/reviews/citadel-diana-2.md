Citadel, an independent spy agency, is wiped out by Manticore, a powerful syndicate that’s desperate to take charge of the world. Diana, an undercover Citadel agent, works as a mole in Manticore. She forges an unexpected rapport with Edo Zani (the heir of Manticore Italy), who is keen on taking the mantle from his father Ettore, grooming himself to be a capable leader.

Matilda De Angelis, as Diana, effectively portrays the transformation of an angsty girl to an intuitive, suave agent – both physically and psychologically. Lorenzo Cervasio, playing Edo Zani, has the more interesting character and there’s adequate mystery and conflict in his performance to justify the writing. Maurizio Lombardi has an ideal authoritarian presence to pull off Ettore.

As a mother caught between the loyalty to her husband and the love for her son, Thekla Reuten is impressive while she lasts. Julia Piaton mirrors the emptiness and the disappointment within Cecile Martin, who’s forced to be a leader in an unexpected situation and compromises on her love. Bernhard Schutz, Filippo Nigro, Giordana Faggiano do justice to their brief roles.

Citadel Diana, a spinoff of Amazon Prime’s Citadel universe (released in 2023, starring Richard Madden, Priyanka Chopra), set in Italy in 2030, casts light on a double agent Diana, who seeks to avenge the death of her parents in a plane crash. She’s hired as an undercover agent for Citadel to infiltrate Manticore, uncover the drama behind a weapon that could potentially destroy the world.
