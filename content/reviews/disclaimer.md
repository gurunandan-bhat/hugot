Gravity and Roma director Alfonso Cuarón's latest project, Disclaimer, is a fascinating and at times uncomfortable drama about a woman accused of being heartless in her past. Oscar winning actress Cate Blanchett steps up to play the aloof Catherine Ravenscroft who finds her perfect life falling apart with the publication of a book. Kevin Kline plays a former teacher who relishes the chance to teach her a lesson. The Apple TV+ series is a riveting story that unfolds chapter by chapter, like a novel.

Disclaimer's Catherine (Blanchett) seems to have it all, with a good family life, stable job and reputation. However, it doesn't take long for all that to fall apart after a calculated plan to take her down emerges in the form of a book called The Perfect Stranger. It alludes to Catherine's past, two decades ago, when she met a young man named Jonathan (Louis Patridge). Years later, her association with him haunts her again as Jonathan's father Stephen (Kline) decides to punish her for her actions in the past.

The series has been adapted from Renée Knight's 2015 novel and Cuarón somehow sticks to its literary roots. The actions of the main protagonists, Catherine and Stephen, are narrated by a voice (Indira Varma), whom we can presume to be an overseer of truth and fiction. Cuarón, who has also adapted the story, directs the story like a page turner. It is all about perspectives and memory; we've all but made up our minds when we forced to look at the whole picture. The series reminds us why we should never judge a book by its cover. In this age of disinformation, it's always better to look further.
