The Shameless became highly recognizable after its Cannes 2024 victory. The film's leading star Anasuya Sengupta made history and became the first Indian actor to win the Best Actress Award at Cannes. The film explores the story of two polar women stuck in the world of prostitution finding hope in each other, but the bleakness and grim reality of the world is always just around the corner to take it away. The film though dramatic and dark has much appreciative theatrical performances with wit of Sengupta's abrasive character. Devi and Renuka keep the story balanced but the outcome is left for the audience to endure.

The film begins with Anasuya Sengupta's character Renuka on the run after having killed a police officer. Renu is a Muslim woman sold at an early age and thrusted into the life of a sex worker without consent, but she stays as that's all she had every known, that's all she can earn money from dispite not being into men. But after killing the police officer she looks at it as a chance to never go back. And yet, after running away to a new city that is the only way she can earn any more money. There she meets Devi, though in the same world polar opposite of her, what brings them close is attraction and love.
