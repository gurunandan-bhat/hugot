You’d think that the world was a less paranoid place five years ago, when the collective trauma of the pandemic hadn’t clobbered us on the head with a comically large mallet. But remember when governments were put on high alert before the release of a comic book movie about a murderous clown? Prepared for the riots that the supposedly incendiary film might incite, teams of police were stationed outside certain screenings of Todd Phillips’ Joker — a movie that was viewed by alarmists as a sort of dog whistle for basement-dwelling incels.

Nothing happened, of course, and Joker went on to become a blockbuster. But its success, fuelled as it was by the apparent ignorance of its central themes, seems to have angered Phillips. His sequel, the even more radical Joker: Folie à Deux, has nothing but disdain for the people who made the first one a bigger box office hit than even Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight.
