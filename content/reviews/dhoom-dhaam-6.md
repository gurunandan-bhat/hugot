Yami Gautam and Pratik Gandhi-led film is a Valentine's Day special release for Netflix. The film directed by Rishab Seth also borderlines on the love connection of a newly married couple. The two only begin to find out about each other after their wedding night is interrupted by goons. The thriller comedy focuses more on the latter in the second half and the performances also shine the best then. It also stars Pavitra Sarkar, Eijaz Khan in pivotal roles which adds most of the fun element in the film and would have been beneficial if also used in the first half. The film begins with Veer and Koyal meeting each other for the first time with their parents. While Koyal's mother is bragging about her skills and how sanskari she is, Veer's mother is bragging about how he is the protector and can provide for anything. Neither of the two seems to have any issues with each other and the family agree on their union but is informed that the wedding has to take place in two weeks or they won't be able to get married for two years. As the festivities begin the two get to know each other a little bit through social media and even less through phone calls.
