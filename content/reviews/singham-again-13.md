Singham Again made quite the impression with its short film for a trailer. It also led to the perception that the film won't have much to offer after everything was revealed in the teasers and trailers. And yet the film surprises with its comedy and its Ramayan connective direction. Rohit Shetty does warn his audience and the religious critics that the film is not meant to disrespect anyone's faith or any religion with a two-minute long disclaimer and what follows is a cameo-filled film with a run time of 144 minutes.

The film begins with an introduction of what Singham has been up to since he was last seen in solo releases. After taking over duties as a cop from Maharashtra to Kashmir, Singham has been handed the position of a chief to a special squat that can work with his special team and cops across the nation, no questions asked. With Singham in charge, no ego clashes are expected from other cops and his work in the industry has made him a big enough hero to have a massive fan following.
