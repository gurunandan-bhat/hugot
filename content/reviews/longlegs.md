As is the norm in promoting any product these days, in the run-up to its theatrical release, Longlegs fell back on social media influencers to market it as the ‘scariest film of the year’. A far more interesting promotional campaign, which quickly went viral, included cryptic ads in newspapers, billboards across Los Angeles comprising nothing but a phone number which, when called, had actor Nicolas Cage, who plays the titular character, whisper ‘threats’ to listeners. A true-crime website was specially designed to detail the antecedents of Longlegs’ long list of victims. A modestly budgeted horror film was turned into an event, which made everyone ask: is Longlegs the most terrifying film in recent times?

The answer to that depends on what expectations you go in with. If you are looking for jump scares, a pacy narrative and a neat, satisfying resolution, then it isn’t. But, a rancid vibe pervades the length and breadth of Longlegs, one trademarked by a surreal atmosphere dripped in satanic madness.
