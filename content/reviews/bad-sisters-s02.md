The first season of Bad Sisters was adapted from the Belgian show Clan, which only ran for one season. The second season, which begins on November 13, takes the story of five close-knit sisters in a whole new direction. Set in Dublin, writer and actress Sharon Hogan brings the black comedy and forges the show ahead in a surprising and moving direction. Bad Sisters retains the shocking surprises, awkward moments, and dark humour that the first season was known for.

The second season picks up two years after the 'death' of Grace's (Anne-Marie Duff) husband, John Paul (Claes Bang). The Garvey sisters, Eva (Sharon Hogan), Ursula (Eva Birthistle), Bibi (Sarah Greene), and Becka (Eve Hewson) are celebrating Grace's marriage to a new man named Ian (Owen McDonnell). However, the events surrounding John Paul's accidental death have still troubled the sisters, as the police and a suspicious neighbour Angelica (Fiona Shaw), won't let bygones be bygones.
