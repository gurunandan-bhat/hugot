Sir is one of those formulaic Tamil movies with a strong cause or message it wants to put across and doesn’t mind doing so at the cost of being a didactic and dated. The style, writing, brevity, and everything that makes up for a superior form take a backseat in Sir as Bose Venkat prefers coming across as an activist to a fine filmmaker. While Sir has a noble cause at its core, the execution makes it a yarnfest, and instead of getting the catharsis such social commentary aims to provide, the film invokes a sense of guilt for feeling so.

The story is about three generations of a family trying to uplift a rural village in Tamil Nadu named Manjolai. In the 1950s, Anna, the protagonist’s grandfather starts an elementary school opposing an upper caste family, to whom educating the oppressed works against their agenda. They will then be unable to control the village in the name of God and superstitions. The fight continues with every generation. Anna’s son Arasu (Saravanan) turns the elementary school into a high school and his dream is to see his son Sivanyanam (Vemal) change it into a higher secondary school. However, both Anna and Arasu are turned into mentally challenged people by the villains, who make the village believe that they are being punished for building the school in the path of their god.
