Weeks after Lucky Bhaskar, a tale of a bank employee whose greed nearly leads to his downfall, another film centred on financial fraud in the banking sector, Zebra, is out in theatres. Incidentally, Zebra also begins with a bank official instructing his subordinates, “We don’t want another Harshad Mehta.” However, the similarities between the films more or less end there.

Zebra is a good example of how a storyteller need not necessarily dumb down a film to connect with his target audience and still deliver a typical masala potboiler. Director Eashvar Karthic (who earlier helmed Penguin) weaves the intricacies of a complex scam into an accessible screenplay that never loses sight of its primary goal — entertainment.
