After years of struggle, the idea of an independent India doesn’t seem a distant dream. The British looks ready to hand over the reins to the country by 1946, but at what cost? Nehru is at odds with Gandhi’s ideals and the interests of the Congress party, while Patel prefers to be the bad cop. A bitter and ailing Jinnah is desperate for the formation of Pakistan. Who has the last laugh?

While the performances in the show are generally satisfying, the casting choices are rather puzzling. Sidhant Gupta presents Nehru’s dilemmas with aching sincerity, but you’re often distracted by the unimaginative styling and makeup. The idea of casting a young actor to play an ageing Nehru works against the show’s interests in a handful of situations.
