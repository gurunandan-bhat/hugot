Pushakar-Gayathri’s Suzhal: The Vortex Season 1 continues to be one of the very few Tamil web series that’s on par with the global standard of such long-form thrillers. It has set a high benchmark that even the second season of Suzhal: The Vortex also fails to reach. Yet, the new season, streaming on Amazon Prime Video still warrants a watch as it has a lot going on for it. While the problem with season 2, directed by Bramma G and Sarjun KM, is largely due to its predictability and convenient writing, it still holds your attention due to a few good streaks of brilliant writing.
