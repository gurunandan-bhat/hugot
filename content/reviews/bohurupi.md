Shiboprosad Mukherjee and Nandita Roy’s Bohurupi delivers what it promises: unadulterated entertainment. It is fun watching this mad cat-and-mouse game. The film is lavishly shot, and most importantly, made with care. It excels in almost every department with Shiboprosad’s skillful acting hogging the lion’s share of the limelight.

To begin with, Bohurupi is based on a well-written script and made almost like a biopic of Bikram’s character. The comedy timing, the chemistry between the two lead pairs, the action sequences – everything seems to have worked suitably along with its script. There is no glaring social commentary and that has allowed the film to emerge as a champion masala entertainer. The second half gets into a bit of melodrama but recovers from it quickly.
