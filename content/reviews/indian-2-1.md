28 years ago, director Shankar and Kamal Haasan gifted 'Indian' to the Tamil audience, who still celebrate it like it's their own. Almost three decades later, the film (read: corruption) still remains relevant. But, Kamal Haasan and Shankar wanted to bring back Indian thatha (grandfather) aka Senapathy to brush up on all the corrupt activities that we've seen so far in umpteen movies, not just in Tamil cinema but across other languages. Chitra Aravindan (Siddharth) and his three friends run a YouTube channel called 'Barking Dogs,' which focuses on parodies and political satire. They end their calls with 'Let's bark!' (If you think this is absurd, hold your horses). After realising that their videos, despite receiving lakhs of views, had little impact on the audience, the team starts a campaign called 'Come Back Indian.' According to them, only Indian Thatha, aka Senapathy, could put an end to corruption.
