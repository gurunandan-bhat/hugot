The trailer of Nadaaniyan- which marks the debut of Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh's son Ibrahim Ali Khan in Bollywood opposite Sridevi's daughter Khushi Kapoor - had given us all enough hints at how bland a film it would be. When I sat down to watch the movie, my expectations were already low considering that the trailer looked unimpressive. But the film, helmed by Shauna Gautam and backed by Karan Johar's Dharmatic, is far lower than what I had expected it to be. A two-hour bland romance drama, Nadaaniyan makes Gen Z -the film's target audience- look dumb, dumber, dumbest, and its lead characters one dimensional with zero sense of rationale and practicality.
