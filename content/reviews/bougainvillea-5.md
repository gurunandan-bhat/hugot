Amal Neerad's Bougainvillea features an impressive cast, including Kunchacko Boban, Jyothirmay, and Fahadh Faasil; however, the film ultimately flatters to deceive. Faasil is relegated to a tertiary role, likely either to help out his friends or for a fat paycheck &ndash; probably the former. Pitched as a psychological thriller, the film becomes exasperating due to its screenplay and overall execution.

For a film of this nature, a concise narrative is essential, along with an assumption that the audience possesses a degree of intelligenceâ€”an area where Bougainvillea falters. Neerad's method involves showing then explaining, and then repeating the 'show part again for those who may still not have grasped it. For example, the film repeatedly informs viewers about the kidnapping of three girls. Once the perpetrator is revealed &ndash; something that becomes evident well before the actual disclosure &ndash; there is little value in depicting all three kidnappings in flashback, as the method remains consistent and ultimately becomes irrelevant.
