“You don’t know what you’re getting into,” warn half-a-dozen faces – an assortment of builders, cops, politicians, media colleagues. Similarly, be warned, you don’t know what you’re getting into, if you switch on writer-director Kanu Behl’s ‘thriller’. Loosely patterned on the daylight murder of real-life investigative reporter J Dey of Mid-day in 2011, Behl and co-writer Ishani Banerjee manage so much incoherence that the only takeaway is of a man flawed by contrasts.

Joy is brave-foolhardy. Ambitious-haphazard. Focussed on a story-distracted by absence of moral fibre. Bravery-blunder. The list is long but to keep it short, Joy is not exactly a bundle of joy. Not for wife Shweta (Shahana Goswami) who craves his attention. Not for girlfriend Prerna (Arrchita Agarwaal) who could do with a more ballsy man. Not for the series of folks, shady, sleazy and otherwise, that he meets to piece together his story.
