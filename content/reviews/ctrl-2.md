With Ctrl, a cautionary tale about the world’s obsession and our near-total dependence on online apps, Vikramaditya Motwane has moved firmly into the future. Or is it the present? Isn’t this what the geeks have been creating with their gaming universes, where your digital avatars are the better, shinier versions of you? Where they slay all the monsters, and leave you &mdash; or rather, your avatar &mdash; fully in control?

Written by Motwane and Avinash Sampath (story by Sampath ; dialogues by Sumukhi Suresh), Ctrl doesn’t hang about in sketching its principal characters, Nella Awasthi (Ananya Panday) and Joe Mascarenhas (Vihaan Samat) whose meet cute at a college festival turns into a relationship whose every beat is celebrated online: anniversaries, cuddles and kisses, and yes, the slew of brand promotions which make it a business, too.
