'The Greatest of All Time' aka 'GOAT' is Thalapathy Vijay's penultimate film before he fully commits to politics. Tracing his career, one would truly understand why 'GOAT' is probably the perfect title for Vijay. Director Venkat Prabhu's spy thriller further establishes Thalapathy Vijay as truly 'the greatest of all time'. Gandhi (Vijay), along with Sunil (Prashanth), Kalyan (Prabhudheva) and Ajay (Ajmal Ameer), forms the Special Anti-Terrorism Squad (SATS), led by Nasser (Jayaram). A fun and efficient team, they get the job done without much hassle. However, when Gandhi takes his pregnant wife (Sneha) and son Jeevan on a mission to Thailand, he faces a tragic loss, prompting him to seek a less risky job.
