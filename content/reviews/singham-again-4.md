There is not a single subtle bone in Singham Again's action-packed, slo-mo loving body. While over-the-top has always been the signature of not only the Singham films but also of director Rohit Shetty's cinema as a whole, Singham Again takes it to level next. Which really isn't a good thing from the point of view of the art and craft of cinema but perhaps works in giving fans of this kind of filmmaking ample bang for their buck.

Shetty's films have often been (rightly) accused of having little or no plot, of sacrificing flights of storytelling for flying cars; of nuance for excessiveness. The Singham franchise is no different. The existence of these films has primarily been to showcase its leading man as an ethically strong, no-nonsense super cop, one who wears his Maharashtrian identity proudly on his sleeve and keeps his emotions for Hindustan close to the heart that beats under his lion-tattooed chest.
