Young Woman and the Sea is a typical sports drama, like the ones that were made often in Hollywood two to three decades ago. The period drama, directed by Joachim Rønning, follows the real-life story of Trudy Ederle, a young American who set some extraordinary records and inspired a whole generation of women after her.

Daisy Ridley, best known for her role in the newer Star Wars trilogy, takes on the physical role of the plucky swimmer who always wanted to push herself. With a compelling supporting cast, director Rønning and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson bring alive the tale of a forgotten woman in sporting history.
