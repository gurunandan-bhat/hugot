The prequel series, Dune: Prophecy, opens with an interesting quote that lays the foundation for its narrative ahead. It states, "Victory is celebrated in the light, but won in the darkness." The HBO show is set around 10,000 years before the existence of Timothee Chalamet's Paul Atreides from Dune; a powerful organisation called the Sisterhood aims to guide humanity to its correct path. Easier said than done.

All "thinking machines" are banned in this world after a harrowing war that nearly exterminated humans. The Sisterhood, led by the Harkonnnen sisters Valya (Emily Watson) and Tula (Olivia Williams), who have different approaches to their ultimate goalâ€”to make sure one of their own sits on the throne to the Imperium. Princess Ynez (Sarah-Sofie Boussnina) is about to join the Sisterhood as an acolyte before she takes the throne. Besides the mysterious Sisterhood, there's plenty of palace intrigue as a newcomer, Desmond Hart (Travis Fimmel), gains the confidence of Emperor Javicco Corrino (Mark Strong).
