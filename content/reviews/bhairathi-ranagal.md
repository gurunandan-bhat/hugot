Shivarajkumar's portrayal of Bhairathi Ranagal in the 2017 movie Mufti was a monumental success. His iconic look—featuring coloured khadi vestis and shirts—became a trendsetter, even inspiring Nandamuri Balakrishna's style in Veera Simha Reddy. It's no surprise that the filmmakers were tempted to delve deeper into the character and cater to the audience's appetite for more. After all, the market rarely gets it wrong, right? Fast forward seven years and director Narthan brings us Bhairathi Ranagal, the origin story of this beloved character.

Bhairathi Ranagal follows a familiar narrative pattern. Set in the fictional Ronapura, the story explores Ranagal's transformation from a determined villager to a feared gangster. Ronapura is a remote village grappling with severe water scarcity. Ranagal, like his father, petitions government officials for help, only to face apathy. After a tipping-point incident, his patience gives way to righteous moral rage.
