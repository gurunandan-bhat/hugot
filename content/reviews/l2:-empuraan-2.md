In the Lucifer universe, created and written by Murali Gopy and directed by Prithviraj Sukumaran, one of the most exciting characters is Baiju Santhosh’s Murukan. A party worker and spy as well as a stand-in for occasional outsider commentary, his quips and nonchalance offer breathing space in the two films that otherwise are busy and eventful. In the sequel, L2: Empuraan, he lists a three-point spiel to accompany a tertiary character’s ascendance. It is momentous, funny and pointed, and has little to do with either Mohanlal or Prithviraj, the pair that forms the pivot for this film, but that is also why it is joyous and spellbinding within the larger philosophy contained in the story. A quickfire lesson in politicking dispensed with ease. The rest of L2: Empuraan is not as lean. It is packed with backstories and details, with word pairs that sound like they were picked from a raffle, like God Axis and Shen Triad. Mohanlal’s Stephen Nedumpally aka Khureshi Ab’raam teleports and levitates. One day he is in Iraq, another day he is somewhere in central Africa. And a few minutes later he is in a developed country in the west. And then makes a grand appearance in Nedumpally, Kerala.
