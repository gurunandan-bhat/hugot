"Let’s give the people what they want,” Lady Gaga’s Harleen “Lee” Quinzel (aka Harley Quinn) declares at a key moment in Joker: Folie a Deux. That seems odd coming from a film that is committed to giving audiences quite the opposite.

After a haul of $1 billion at the box office, the Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival, 11 Academy Award nominations and the first-ever Oscar for Joaquin Phoenix, director Todd Phillips knew it would be carte blanche for him when it came to the inevitable sequel to 2019’s intriguing if ultimately superficial Joker. Five years later, Phillips, armed with a follow-up with ample promise and potential but little in terms of premise and plot, has, unfortunately, squandered that opportunity.
