THE WILD ROBOT is about an all-purpose robot that turns sentient in the wilderness. After washing up on a forest island, Rozzum “Rozz” 7134 learns to feel and discern once it mothers an orphaned goose and befriends a red fox. I’d say it becomes human, but in the context of where we are today, “it grows a heart” is more accurate.

The premise is not earth-shatteringly original; cautionary and cute robot tales are the cornerstone of animated cinema and science fiction. A machine coming alive through motherhood is a familiar allegory. An unlikely ‘interspecies’ family is the core of cross-cultural comedy. Ecological fairy tales and deforestation metaphors featuring animals joining paws, claws and wings to defeat manmade evils — we’ve seen it all before.

Which is to say: The Wild Robot is very simple. But it's this simplicity that is the point. Like its protagonist, the film itself is definitive proof that no matter how much technology evolves, it cannot override the austerity of love. In the age of artificial intelligence, heavy metaphors and VFX-heavy spectacles, there’s nothing like a story that commits to the basics — the inherent wonder and the inbuilt fantasy — of animated storytelling. The hand-painted images, the disparate personalities of the characters, the all-ages writing and the utopian relationships reclaim the focus of the genre.
