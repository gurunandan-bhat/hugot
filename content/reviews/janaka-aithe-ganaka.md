Telugu cinema has consistently portrayed stories where protagonists embody middle-class values — from Needi Naadi Oke Katha and Middle Class Melodies to Middle Class Abbayi (MCA) and The Family Star. Interestingly, Dil Raju, the producer behind two of these films, also backs Janaka Aithe Ganaka this week. The Sandeep Reddy Bandla directorial, starring Suhas, aims to acknowledge and appreciate the bread-winners of middle-class households, in the guise of a courtroom drama.

Prasad (Suhas), a married man, is a salesperson for a washing machine manufacturing company. Dissatisfied with having been brought up with compromises, and fearing that he and his wife may not be financially able to raise a child, the couple decide against parenthood, until their decision backfires.

The film takes off in style as Sandeep establishes the interpersonal relationships in Prasad’s family with a hint of satire. Prasad keeps quarrelling with his father Ramana over the latter’s bad real estate investments, shares a love-hate relationship with his grandmother, and buys jalebis for his wife in the evenings. He beats weekday work blues at a bar with a lawyer friend.
