Among all the flaws a writer can imagine for their protagonist, an unreliable memory throws up quite a few fascinating possibilities. In Bougainvillea, Reethu (Jyothirmayi) is almost always unsure of anything that happens right in front of her eyes. For a fairly good period, we are also caught in a similar dilemma — as to whether what we are seeing through her eyes is for real; whether she has painted a Sunflower or yet another Bougainvillea.

In a film as imperfect as the central character’s memory, it is these zones of uncertainty that the makers manage to create through Reethu that work best. Her case of retrograde amnesia is attributed to a road accident, which happened eight years before the events in the film. Royce (Kunchacko Boban), her husband, takes care of her with an added touch of gentleness, just as he takes care of the patients at the hospital he works in. The delicate balance of their life is upset when the police investigation over the case of a missing girl lands up at their doorstep.
