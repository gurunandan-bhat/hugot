The opening stretch of Raghu Thathatakes us back to the ‘60s. Even as the opening credits roll, we are shown newspaper clippings of important developments in that period. Anti-Hindi slogans and protests are rampant in Tamil Nadu, a state that is furiously vocal against the imposition of Hindi. Indira Gandhi has taken over as the first woman Prime Minister of the country, something that should ideally given women across the country a lot more confidence and freedom.

But that’s not the case for Kayalvizhi, growing up in Valluvanpettai, a small village in Tamil Nadu. When we first see Kayalvizhi (Keerthy Suresh), she’s wearing a shirt. She tells her mother who asks her to dress properly: “Ponna adakamalan iruka mudiyathu’” (I’m not interested in being a proper lady). There’s defiance in her voice, and what stands out — right in that very first dialogue itself — is how Kayal does not even wait for her mother to complete her sentence and retorts immediately with a resounding ‘no’.
