A characteristic in all of director Siva's movies that I strongly dislike is the lack of subtlety in emotions and reactions. Everything is loud—and sometimes even louder than Boyapati Srinu's films. But if you can look past this trait, Kanguva might just be one of the most cinematic spectacles you’ve experienced in theatres in a long time.

For audiences to connect with a character and their struggles, the actors portraying them must commit wholeheartedly. No matter how trivial a scene may appear, if actors fully dedicate themselves, even the toughest audience will eventually buy into it. Take, for example, Christian Bale in American Psycho—he convinces you that Patrick Bateman would actually drive an axe through the face of a colleague who enjoys slightly finer things. You don’t question the logic; you marvel at the madness. That's the power of an actor fully committing to their role, embodying their character's beliefs and emotions without judgment.
