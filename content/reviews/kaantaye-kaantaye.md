After their daughter died in a car crash, advocate PK Basu (Saswata Chatterjee) and his wife Rani (Ananya Chatterjee) go to North Bengal to recover from their grief. They visit their family friends Sujata (Ayoshi Talukdar) and Kaushik (Somraj Maity) who open a homestay there. A series of murders take place in Kolkata and North Bengal. As a number of characters get stranded in the homestay, PK Basu catches the culprit.

Narayan Sanyal’s Kaanta series is essentially a borrowed work from Agatha Christie’s murder mysteries. Kaantaye Kaantaye is based on The Mousetrap — which gets acknowledged by the director as one of the characters, Nur Ali Baig (Kinjal Nanda), is seen reading the book. It has been adapted on the screen a number of times. Those who know the original story will find the series long and boring.
