Abhishek Bachchan is shaping into quite a father figure. From playing one to his real-life 'Paa' Amitabh Bachchan wherein the latter's progeria condition ages him dramatically to the point of infirmity, an estranged dad of a precocious kid he reunites with under curious circumstances in Ludo, a divorced daddy surviving medical issues of the life-threatening kind while navigating a bumpy relationship with his daughter in I Want to Talk to a single dad of a smart-alecky princess harbouring dancer dreams in Be Happy, Abhishek has embarked on quite a few journeys where his parenting skills are put to test. Unlike the textbook Papas trickling with emotional wisdom and snuggly warmth, Abhishek's silently supportive approach, playful sarcasm and sparingly expressed authority conveys a father figuring it out as he goes along.
