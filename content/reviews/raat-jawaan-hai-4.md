Three childhood friends and stay-at-home parents Avinash, Radhika and Suman come to terms with adulthood, marriage and parenting in a metropolis, dealing with one blow after the other. While Avinash is in no mood to return to work soon, Radhika is in two minds about taking up a job. Suman, content with motherhood, struggles to take a stance for herself.

Barun Sobti has consistently picked stories that have defied stereotypes and audience expectations around him – and Raat Jawaan Hai is no different. He’s comfortable in the shoes of Avinash, the stay-at-home dad. If Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani showed what Anjali Anand was capable of, this series further consolidates her position as a bankable performer, playing a modern-day mom.

Priya Bapat continues to have a great 2024 after two terrific outings – Visfot and Zindaginama. She makes a meal out of a superbly fleshed-out character here as well. Cast as the on-screen partners of the leads, Hasleen Kaur, Priyansh Jora and Vikram Singh Chauhan deliver the goods too.
