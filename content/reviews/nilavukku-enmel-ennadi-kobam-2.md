That Dhanush is an extraordinary actor is known to everyone. He also proved his mettle as a director with his debut film, Pa Paandi, and Raayan. His third directorial venture is Nilavuku Enmel Ennadi Kobam aka NEEK, a romantic comedy centred on a bunch of youngsters that generated positive buzz. Will it help Dhanush strike a hat-trick? Let's find out! Prabhu (Pavish Narayan) is an aspiring chef who is in love with failure. His best friend, Rajesh (Mathew Thomas) has been by his side through ups and downs. Prabhu's parents (Saranya Ponvannan and Aadukalam Naren) inform him about a potential match and force him to visit the girl's home with them. With reluctance, he ends up at his school friend Preethi (Priya Prakash Varrier's home. Prabhu and Preethi decide to date for a week before they can decide on moving forward.
