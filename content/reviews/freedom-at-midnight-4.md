"At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom”. This momentous line from Jawaharlal Nehru’s Tryst with Destiny speech, delivered on the eve of India’s Independence on August 15, 1947, remains etched in the annals of history. What also remains an indelible part of our country’s birth into freedom after 200 years of colonial rule is the bloodied, agonising, gut-wrenching division of one nation into two.

Screens both big and small have long explored India’s tenuous path to gaining freedom. Whether it is the stories of India’s bravehearts who prioritised the dream of a free India before their own lives, or biopics of the leaders and visionaries of the time.
