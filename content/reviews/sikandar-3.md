They're red carpets laid out by formula-favouring filmmakers for 'Bhai' to strut around in slow motion and assert his stardom to indulgent fans again and again and again. But surely, even the most accommodating Bhai bhakts have a breaking point, especially when the red carpet resembles a tattered rug trod on by a hubris high superstar wearing sunglasses so shiny he cannot read the writing on the wall: STOP. There's not any effort &mdash; not even a smidgen &mdash; to resurrect a superstar on the wane in Sikandar by A R Murugadoss. Instead, you get dialogues like 'Insaaf nahi saaf karna hai.' Four writer credits (Murugadoss, Rajat Aroraa, Hussain Dalal, Abbas Dalal) and this is what they came up with?
