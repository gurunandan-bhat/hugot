A slow-burn thriller with a deep emotional core, an intricately plotted genre exercise, and an acting showcase for two talented young performers, Caddo Lake, on paper, sounds like the complete package. It takes a while to get going, and the first act is particularly testing, but it’s also the kind of film that gets better with every passing minute. In fact, Caddo Lake is at its best towards the end, when it ties all — or, at least two — of its narrative threads together, unleashing an emotional wallop that rivals only the sheer thrill of watching its well-executed twist.

This shouldn’t come as a surprise; Caddo Lake is produced by M Night Shyamalan, but despite its climactic flourish, the film is its own beast. Directed by Celine Held and Logan George, the movie adopts a more naturalistic aesthetic to tell its rooted — sometimes literally — story about family ties and fractured relationships. Unlike the tightly composed shots in Shyamalan’s own movies, the handheld work in Caddo Lake — the movie is set in the lush swamplands of Texas — feels less showy. You could be fooled into thinking that you’re watching a Sundance drama. But it doesn’t take too long for the film to show its true colours.
