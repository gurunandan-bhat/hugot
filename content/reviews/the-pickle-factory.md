The Pickle Factory is what happens when The Office (U.S.) and Better Life Foundation (India) reluctantly get married (arranged) and have a pious, Doordarshan-loving child that refuses to grow up. It’s the kind of stagey and adolescent workplace comedy that went out of fashion years ago. You want it to work, of course, for several reasons. The 10-episode show revolves around the quirky employees of a family-run pickle company; imagine the readymade Hindi ‘achaar’ proverbs.

The cast is quite promising as well. Ritwik Bhowmik is fresh off the success of Bandish Bandits Season 2; Gagan Dev Riar broke through as master scammer Abdul Karim Telgi in Scam 2003: The Telgi Story; watching Naveen Kaushik in a modest homegrown company brings back memories of his scene-stealing role as Nitin in Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year (2009). There’s also the production company, Dice Media, one of the first movers in the Indian streaming space; viral hit Little Things aside, the recent Ghar Waapsi (2022) marked a proper evolution of mid-budget, urban storytelling.
