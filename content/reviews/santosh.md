Santosh which has been making rounds in the top film festivals including Cannes is by the British-Indian director Sandhya Suri. Focusing on the state of rural India through the eyes of a young femal cop, the film is is Suri's first fiction feature, which can be seen in its rawness and sincerity. The film is led by Shahana Goswami and Sunita Rajwar as cops on the other side of the law, and their performances are unforgettable.

The film's story beings with its titular character Santosh. She is a driven young Hindu widow, while fierce and unruly in her own home, her status in the new police station changes her behaviour through out the film. After losing her husband to his job, Santosh bags his job as a female constable thanks to a government scheme. The film doesn't waste time with putting through the training and then giving her a job, but instead it puts her in the khaki uniform quickly also putting the weight of it on her with the first case. In the village, where she has been moved she finds the usual cases of love affairs, people taking advantage of the cops, cops taking advantages of situation as the cast system overshadowing everything.
