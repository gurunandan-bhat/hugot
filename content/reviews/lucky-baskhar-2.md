While promoting his latest movie, Lucky Baskhar, director Venky Atluri claimed that one of his biggest strengths is his talent in screenwriting. However, those closely following his filmography would tell you that his ability to assemble a stellar cast is his greatest asset. He once again showcases this strength with Lucky Baskhar.

Dulquer Salmaan is pitch-perfect as Baskhar Kumar, a working-class bank employee. In the late 80s, Baskhar, like millions of his countrymen, firmly believes that he could overcome his financial struggles by holding an honest, steady job. He is dedicated to his role as a cashier, showing up to work on time every day, the first to arrive and the last to leave. Known for his loyalty, respect for others, and charm, Baskhar embodies the ideal Indian man personality. He works hard for three years in hopes of earning a promotion that could alleviate his familyâ€™s middle-class challenges.
