In among the best stretches of Vettaiyan, the friend of an accused—both hailing from the slums—is being interrogated for his assistance in facilitating the latter’s escape, and the police eagerly slap their biases on them. Director TJ Gnanavel quietly, and subtly captures the indignation of these two young men at various times, as they square up to the police forces. It takes a great line about friendship from Athiyan (Rajinikanth) to restore a bit of faith in the young man’s eyes.

In star vehicles that suffer trying to humanise even one character, it’s a mark of Gnanavel’s kind intentions that in this Rajinikanth film, he’s able to do that to a peripheral character we barely see much of. In such ways, the film eagerly rushes to the defence of the misunderstood. The story of ‘Battery’ (Fahadh) is a great example—like he were an extension of Di Caprio from Catch Me If You Can. Not once is he shamed for his past; in fact, the film treats him with almost the same reverence and affection that Athiyan gets—and almost, if not more, screentime.
