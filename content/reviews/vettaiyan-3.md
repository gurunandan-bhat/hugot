Vettaiyan brings together two cinematic legendsâ€”Rajinikanth as Athiyan, a top cop delivering swift justice, and Amitabh Bachchan as Justice Sathyadev Bramhadutt Pande, who questions the very foundation of that justice. Director TJ Gnanavel sets up a thought-provoking premise that wrestles with themes of morality, justice, and redemption, but unfortunately, the film struggles to deliver a compelling narrative.

At the heart of Vettaiyan is Athiyan, a law enforcer who is celebrated by the media and the public for his efficiency in "solving" cases. When he's tasked with eliminating a fugitive, he executes his mission within 48 hours, and society hails him as a hero. But the entry of Justice Sathyadev turns the narrative on its head. The justice's presence forces Athiyan to confront an unsettling truth: Did he really kill the right man?
