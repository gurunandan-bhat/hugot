The millennial attempting to retain individuality and identity, while holding on to old friendships and coping with being a new parent, is a demographic that has hardly, if ever, been represented on the Indian screen. Even if it has been, it has been reduced to a strand or a subplot in a coming-of-age story. The fact that it even goes down this route immediately sets Raat Jawaan Hai apart. That it does it well, making its eight episodes a breezy watch which you want to hold on to and hope it doesnâ€™t end, is a huge feather in its cap. This is a definite clutter-breaker in the Indian streaming space. One which has been long overdue.

Created and written by Khyati Anand-Puthran and directed by actor Sumeet Vyas, Raat Jawaan Hai is a simple story about complex relationships which also becomes a complex story about simple relationships. That it is built around relatable characters and identifiable situations and tackles seemingly sticky circumstances with a lightness of touch makes it an effective watch.

Anchored by three inseparable childhood friends, now in their 30s and parents to toddlers, Raat Jawaan Hai draws its title from the name of the WhatsApp group that Avinash (Barun Sobti), Radhika (Anjali Anand) and Suman (Priya Bapat) share. While Radhika and Suman are homemakers, Avi has chosen to be a stay-at-home dad to take care of his infant while his wife pursues a successful career as a lawyer.
