Bridget Jones Mad About The Boy explores a new chapter in the life of Bridget Jones after the death of Mark Dary. The film doesn't do well for Renee Zellweger's character as it continues to progressively not age throughout the series. However, the second half of the film focuses on a typical rom-com setting which works well for the film. It also brings more closure to all subplots and concerns that Bridget and her kids have. The film is as goofy and silly as earlier films in the series were and it is the nostalgia and emotional closure for the audience that keeps the film engaging. The film begins with Bridget going to visit Mark's friends on his death anniversary. When he thinks about bailing her son reminds her, that it is the one day she leaves the house. At the party, it becomes obvious that even four years after his death she has not been able to move on, nor does she plan to do it. However, her friends demand that she return to work to be able to live a normal, healthy life. After recalling her father's last wish that 'she lives and not just survives after the death of her husband', Bridget begins to take an interest in returning to work.
