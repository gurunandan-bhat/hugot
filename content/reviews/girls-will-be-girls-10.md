In an unspecified North Indian hilltown boarding school, a girl comes of age. That overused phrase ‘coming-of-age’ is a misnomer when it comes to mainstream Hindi cinema: the years between thirteen and eighteen are those where contradictory impulses leap between synapses, with mind and body taking off in opposite directions, and explorations of both taking you into spaces where you’ve never been before.

These are elements Bollywood has never been comfortable with. Even if films do get made around this subject, their teenagers are either carefully sanitized or overtly fetishised. The result: infantilised characters and viewers, who’ve never been given a chance to grow up.
