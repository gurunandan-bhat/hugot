The clock’s ticking for Satya (Alia Bhatt) in Vasan Bala’s Jigra. Her brother Ankur (Vedang Raina) is on death row in an island nation called Hanshi Dao (a fictitious version of Singapore), and she’s just gotten news that the date of his execution has been expedited for an attempted jailbreak. What was supposed to happen in a few weeks, will now happen in a few days. We see her face computing all possible ploys as fast as she can, and then deciding on a plan of action. It’s not going to be pretty, an accomplice warns, but she’s already made up her mind. The accomplice backs out, telling Satya that she’ll be on her own. “I never said I was a hero. I’ll understand if you don’t wish to join me,” she says, “but don’t get in my way.”

Vasan Bala’s films have often been rooted in their affection for pop culture, but his reinvention of Amitabh Bachchan’s ‘angry young man’ through a petite-looking Bhatt is among his biggest successes in his brief career. Bhatt plays Satya, a human form of a sledge hammer: lean, no wasted movement, striking with purpose.
