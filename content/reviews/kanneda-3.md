Nimma, a Punjabi immigrant, faces racism, forcing him into Sarab’s gang. He rises quickly, but Rawat’s mole threatens their empire. Gang wars erupt, demanding Nimma’s fierce loyalty. Sarab’s arrest leaves Nimma vulnerable, surviving an attack. A coma, addiction, and betrayal follow. Sarab escapes, leading to a vengeful confrontation between him and Nimma, fuelled by chaos and loss. Parmish Verma, the popular musician, bares his heart out to portray the angst and the chaos within Nimma. However, with more effort to internalise the role, he could have created a more lasting impact. Aadar Malik, as Nimma’s on-screen bestie and musician, has an impressive screen presence, helping him emote with precision. Kanneda is an important show, capturing the immigrant experience through an insider’s lens, reminding us that Indian stories needn’t always be home-soil bound. The series serves as a cautionary tale, depicting a 90s Punjabi life in Canada gone wrong – a musician lost in drugs, crimes, and gangs. Despite everyone’s attempts to help and transform him, redemption eludes him.
