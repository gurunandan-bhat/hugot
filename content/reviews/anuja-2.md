Anuja begins with a girl telling her tween sibling a Panchatantra story about how a faithful mongoose saved a farmer's child from a poisonous snake yet was mistaken for an attacker because of his master's impetuous impulses. Making a thoughtful decision is central to writer-director Adams J Graves' Oscar-nominated live-action short film -- backed by the likes of Guneet Monga, Mindy Kaling and Priyanka Chopra Jones -- about a pair of orphaned sisters inhabiting Delhi's grimy, shabby slums.
