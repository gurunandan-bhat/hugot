All right folks, we are back in the labyrinth. For a third time. Lots of stuff that we remember from the earlier outings. Creaky two-hundred-year-old Bengali havelis. Locked rooms. Vengeful ‘aatmas’. Ghosts who flit about. And characters who spout their lines, and vanish.

So. Kartik Aaryan is Rooh Baba, a bogus ghostbuster. Accompanied always by the vertically challenged Tilu (Arun Kushwah). Grabbed by the very modern miss Meera (Tripti Dimri) and her uncle (Rajesh Sharma). Transported to said haveli, in order to bust the ghost of Monjulika. Remember her?
