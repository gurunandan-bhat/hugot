Both Kajol and Kriti Sanon embark on a couple of firsts in Shashanka Chaturvedi's directorial debut Do Patti. Written by Kanika Dhillon, the Hindi film sees Kajol as tough-on crime police officer and Kriti takes on a double role as twin sisters. The Netflix suspense drama relies on a couple of red herrings eventually emerging as a wobbly thriller with a message.

The story takes place in a picturesque hill station where our protagonists' noses and cheeks are constantly rosy due to the chill factor. Police inspector Vidya Jyothi aka VJ (Kajol) is determined to prove that Saumya (Kriti) is being abused by her husband Dhruv Sood (Shaheer Sheikh). She finally gets her opportunity but realises something is off about the larger picture. The timid Saumya has few people in her corner; even her outgoing twin Shailee (also Kriti) has betrayed her enough times. So how does Saumya finally accept Vidya Jyothi's help?
