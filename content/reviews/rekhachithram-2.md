A guilt-ridden elderly man Rajendran confesses to a crime he had committed 40 years ago and commits suicide, recording the same on Facebook. A suspended cop Vivek is entrusted with the case which involves the discovery of skeletal remains connected to the disappearance of a young woman from the set of Mammoottyâ€™s 1985 film Kathodu Kathoram. Vivek is desperate for answers. Asif Ali is fast cementing his authority as one of the most bankable actors in modern-day Malayalam cinema. Rekhachithram is a worthy follow-up to his other recent thrillers Thalavan and Kishkindha Kaandam. Anaswara Rajan fits perfectly as a Mammootty fan girl, who aspires for a career in films, playing her part with verve, innocence and integrity.
