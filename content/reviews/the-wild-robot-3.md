The Wild Robot, inspired by Peter Brown's 2016 novel of the same
name, is a film that skillfully balances its emotional elements, resulting in a gratifying experience for both children and adults. While the notion of a robot experiencing emotions is not entirely original, it is the narrative and its execution that truly set this film apart. Achieving the right emotional resonance, whether from a human or a robot, is crucial, and Chris Sanders has struck gold with this film.

In the realm of animation, filmmakers have the freedom to explore imaginative concepts, including anthropomorphic animals and fantastical scenarios. The integration of advanced technology also allows for breathtaking visuals; however, the essence of a compelling film lies in its cohesive storyline, which Sanders and his team have effectively delivered. Although the premise of a robot nurturing an orphaned goose may initially seem implausible, The Wild Robot succeeds in evoking an emotional response.
Sanders has described the film as a 'Monet painting in a Miyazaki forest: When your ambitions are so high, even if you succeed fractionally, you've still done a good job, and Sanders has done better than that
