Satya has been running from window to window in the anteroom of a maximum security prison. She’s desperate to see her brother before closing time, but there are forms to fill, procedures to follow. Finally, she ends up at the door to the visiting area, wheezing, frantic. The guard does her a kindness, says she isn’t late and will be let in soon. Satya catches her breath, but can’t wipe the worry off. “Do I look sad?” she asks the guard as she’s about to enter. “Little sad,” he replies in Malay-accented English. She puts on a strained smile. “Now?” The guard shakes his head. “Very sad, lah.”

Earlier in his career, Vasan Bala wouldn’t have stopped for this scene. His second and third films, Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota (2018) and Monica, O My Darling (2022), are fantastically entertaining, high-energy genre tributes that often skirt pastiche (I haven’t seen his first, the unreleased Peddlers). It isn’t a criticism to say there isn’t a soul-searching character in either; these films have no need of one. But with his fourth film, Bala, like Satya, takes a breath. Jigra operates within the bounds of the prison break genre, but isn’t beholden to it. The result is something richer and more affecting than we’ve seen from him till now.
