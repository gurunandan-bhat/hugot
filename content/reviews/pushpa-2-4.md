It opens on a Japanese port with a clever twist to the famous song ‘Mera joota hai Japani’, giving a miss to the second line that talks of the country, now an aggressor. But the aggression in the film is a given. What follows is a high-on-adrenaline action sequence almost like a climactic scene. So, where can Pushpa go from such a strong build-up? Well, back to where it began, right to Pushpa’s childhood and the indignities he suffered due to his illegitimate bearings.

When ‘Pushpa: The Rise’ came in 2021, it was one of the few films to bridge the North-South audience gap, a film rooted in its soil but one that appealed to pan-Indian sensibilities. Truly a beast of its own kind, in no time it became a blockbuster. Three years later, it can only grow bigger in scale and execution. But, is bigger better? Well, depends on whether you believe in the brand power of Pushpa, aka Allu Arjun. Time and again, we are reminded how Pushpa is a brand, with one of the film’s many whistle-worthy dialogues like ‘Pushpa sirf ek naam nahi, Pushpa matlab brand’.
