Based on the novels of Hugh Howey, the world of Silo easily captivated sci-fi fans when it first premiered in May 2023. The dystopian drama is set in a future where thousands of people have isolated themselves in a giant underground silo to protect themselves from the outside. But what exactly is outside? The gripping new season, led by Rebecca Ferguson, finally takes us beyond the silo we've known for the first season.

Last we saw Juliette (Ferguson), the engineer-turned-sheriff was forced outside by judicial security head Robert (Common) and mayor Bernard (Tim Robbins). The first episode of season two is fittingly titled The Engineer, as the resourceful Juliette returns to her mechanical background as she finds another silo and a mysterious new outsider.
