Created by Bill Lawrence, star Jason Segel and Brett Goldstein, Shrinking focuses on a grieving therapist who decides to change his approach with his patients. Becoming more proactive, he becomes more involved in the lives of those around, both to his detriment and betterment. The second season of Shrinking charms with its loveable, goofball characters and some unexpected new faces.

Jimmy Laird (Segel) has managed to break out of the funk after his wife's death and be present for his daughter Alice (Lukita Maxwell). His colleagues Paul (Harrison Ford) and Gaby (Jessica Williams) are also dealing with their issues revolving around health and family, but they always make time for one another. Meanwhile, the arrival of a formerly shadowy figure in the Lairds' lives shakes up the dynamics.

The second season expands to more of an ensemble comedy as the makers focus on all the characters in the series. This time, the writers delve into the seemingly happy marriage of Jimmy's neighbours Liz (Christa Miller) and Derek (Ted McGinley) and his best friend Brian (Michael Urie). Alice and Ford's Paul are also forced to own up to their insensitive behaviours.
