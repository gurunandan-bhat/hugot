There’s a lot going on within twelfth-grader Mira (Preeti Panigrahi). Chosen as the first female head prefect at her seemingly orthodox hill-station boarding school, she’s battling most of the pressures and anxieties of being a teenager, while simmering in the shadow of her vivacious mother Anila (Kani Kusruthi). Mira needs to keep her scores up, balance the shifted power dynamic with friends and bullies because of her duties as a head prefect, and rein in her excessively eager hormones for the mysterious new boy – Srinivas (Kesav Binoy Kiron) – in class.

On the cusp of discovering her own politics as an individual, while fiercely resisting ancient wisdom of the elders around her, Mira is a wonderful concoction of a stoic young woman with a mature worldview – so much so that one could mistake her for an adult. Her inexperience comes through in moments when her fixed worldview is challenged by life’s curveballs – she’s naive enough to think her value system clearly demarcates between right and wrong. She’s about to find out life is mostly a series of choosing between lesser evils.
