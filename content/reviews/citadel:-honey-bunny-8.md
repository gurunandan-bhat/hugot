Sometimes you get what you want, but it’s not what you need. Since 2018, Raj & DK have been on a creative streak. It began with Stree, a horror-comedy sleeper hit they wrote and produced. The following year, their first series, The Family Man, premiered on Amazon Prime; they show-ran and co-directed it over two seasons (a third is in the works). This was followed by two more shows, Farzi (on Amazon)—my favourite of their long-form work—and Guns & Gulaabs (on Netflix). With each success, the possibility that Hollywood would come calling seemed likelier.

When it did, it was royalty on the line. The Russo brothers—co-directors of four Marvel entries, among them the second- and sixth-highest-grossing films of all time—were executive producing an ambitious new spy series called Citadel in the pipeline for Amazon. Spin-offs had been planned in various countries, including India. Raj & DK were never going to say no. Perhaps they should have.
