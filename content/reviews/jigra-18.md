Getting an audience to detest a movie villain isn’t difficult. People are cynical; all they want is someone to project their frustrations on. But getting the same viewers to genuinely empathise with the protagonist of your film isn’t as easy as it might seem. It requires them to lower their guards and shed their egos; to allow moments of vulnerability in the presence of absolute strangers. Most of all, it requires them to ignore the objectively lunatic act of developing a connection with a made-up person, as if they are real. But Vasan Bala has cracked the code in Jigra — a film that pulls off this almost impossibly difficult feat by getting you, the viewer, to participate in the grandest act of collective empathy crafted on a Bollywood screen this year.

After building a career on irreverent genre films, it’s somewhat surprising to see that the most effective parts of Jigra are the ones in which Bala is being absolutely earnest. To be clear, he finds plenty of room for his trademark cine-literate flourishes — there are cameos, on-the-nose hat-tips to master filmmakers, and several other overt and covert references to past classics. At one point, someone literally name drops Wong Kar-wai and Kim Ki-duk. A separate article, perhaps, can be written on the singularly subversive act of placing a Nicolas Winding Refn reference in a movie that opens with the Kuch Kuch Hota Hai theme. But here’s the thing; all of this is just adornment. What truly makes Jigra a great movie is, funnily enough, the Dharma-ism at its core.
