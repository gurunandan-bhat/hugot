Earlier this year, the second part of Lindsay Lohan's acting comeback commenced with Irish Wish. The actress played a woman who is about to watch her best friend marry her longtime crush in Ireland. This time, Lohan is back with another romantic dilemma in Our Little Secret. Taking place at Christmas, Lohan's character Avery meets her ex Logan (Ian Harding) at her new boyfriend's house. Hilarity is supposed to ensue, but there's very little to laugh about.

Avery and Logan are childhood sweethearts who have a bad breakup in December 2014. Ten years later, they come face to face again at Christmas when they find out they're dating siblings. Avery, who wants to impress her possible mother-in-law Erica (Kristin Chenoweth), lies and pretends she's never met Logan, and the misunderstandings start off from there. From there, the film proceeds to vault Avery into one embarrassing situation after another. From getting high at church to pretending to be a sick dog, the list just gets longer, all while pushing the former lovers back together again.
