Crazxy led by Sohum Shah follows after the actor's biggest hit Tumbbad. While the new release is nothing close to the fantasy horror, it does bring a new and unique concept to the big screen. However, the promotional material from the film does not line up with the real concept nor does it bring the right expectations from the film. The misdirection adds to the mystery but doesn't last long as the plot turns predictable early one. The film's climax also leaves much to be desired despite the concept. The film begins with Sohum Shah getting ready with a massive bag on his way to the hospital, getting bombarded with calls about reaching on time. Early on, the makers establish that Sohum's character Abhimanyu isn't the good guy. He is set up at the obnoxious ex-husband, a terrible father and a doctor who does not care much for the patients. He is about to settle a big case, and pay for his life with the 5 crore in his car, and move on with his new girlfriend. However, one phone call changes it all.
