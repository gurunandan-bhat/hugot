Films with a military background, most times, evoke strong feelings in one’s heart. Not just that, it’s a constant reminder that the army men are toiling in difficult terrain just to keep everyone safe. And when Amaran, a biopic on the life of Major Mukund Varadarajan, was announced, it piqued everyone’s interest. The expectations rose sky-high when Sivakarthikeyan, who has so far done boy-next-door roles, was roped in to headline the film. For the unversed, Amaran is an adaptation of the book series, India’s Most Fearless: True Stories of Modern Military Heroes by Shiv Aroor and Rahul Singh. Mukund Varadarajan (Sivakarthikeyan) has his goals set right from fifth standard. A field trip to the Officers Training Academy (OTA) in Chennai sowed the seeds of joining the military in him. Years later, while pursuing his graduation at Madras Christian College, he meets his ladylove Indhu Rebecca Varghese (Sai Pallavi). They fall head over heels in love with each other. For Indhu, she has to love Mukund and his passion as well.
