Neighbour duo Lolita (Debchandrima Singha Roy) and Shekhar (Gourav Chakrabarty) have unending claim on each other. Despite a marriage in haste, they parted ways because of Shekhar’s prejudices and Lolita’s pride. In Parineeta, Saratchandra Chattopadhyay's classic takes a makeover in Aditi Roy’s series on Hoichoi.

Saratchandra Chattopadhyay’s Parineeta, as a plot, is clearly dated. And yet its unsullied charm of old-school romance makes it fascinating even today. The original story was adapted on the big screen a number of times. Soumitra Chatterjee and Mousumi Chatterjee’s Parineeta was directed by Ajar Kar. Meena Kumari and Ashok Kumar played the lead in Bimal Roy’s film. Most recently, Vidya Balan and Saif Ali Khan’s Parineeta – directed by Pradeep Sarkar – was released in 2005 and was one of the highest-grossing films of that year.
