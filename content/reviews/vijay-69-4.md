The sports film Vijay 69, starring Anupam Kher, is about a sexagenarian who realises that he's not achieved much in his life. He decides to become the oldest man to run a triathlon in India, trying to prove all the naysayers wrong. Anupam Kher ably steps to play the cranky senior citizen who finds new meaning with this ambitious goal. While filmmaker Akshay Roy's is well-meaning and inspiring, it is a bit meandering in its storytelling that veers from full comedy to drama often.

Vijay Mathew gets the shock of his life when he walks in on his own funeral. After the early misunderstanding, he realises that his near and dear ones don't really know him that well. A former swimming champion, Vijay wants an important achievement to define his eventual eulogy. He is spurned on to participate in a triathlon after an 18-year-old boy, Aditya (Mihir Ahuja), wants to become the youngest competitor from his colony. Thus begins Vijay's quirky journey as he trains for the hardest battle of life.
