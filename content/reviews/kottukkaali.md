Director PS Vinothraj announced his arrival in Tamil cinema with 'Koozhangal', a film which won the coveted Tiger Award at the 50th International Film Festival Rotterdam. His second film, 'Kottukkaali', brings together Anna Ben and Soori for the first time and has already garnered appreciation in the international market. Now, Kottukkaali is set to make its mark in the Indian market. Meena (Anna Ben) is confined to her home, with everyone around her speaking in hushed tones. She refuses to speak and appears distressed. Her relatives claim that she is possessed by a spirit. Meena, her mother, her fiance Pandi (Soori), and others embark on a journey to a temple to ward off the evil.
