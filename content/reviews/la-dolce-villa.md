Every year around Valentine's Day, the streamers trot out generic romance films that help you pass the time but don't leave any impact. Director Mark Waters's latest film La Dolce Villa, starring Scott Foley and Maia Reficco, is no exception. Set in the gorgeous Italian countryside, the breezy romantic comedy on Netflix will have you booking your next ticket to the country. Former chef turned business consultant Eric (Scott Foley) rushes to Italy after he finds his 24-year-old daughter Olivia (Maia Reficco) is buying a run-down villa for one euro. Determined to stop her, he lands in the fictional Montezara and ends up falling for the town's mayor, Francesca (Violante Placido). As the father and daughter heal their relationship, they become part of the family in the Montezara as well.
