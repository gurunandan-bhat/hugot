After his tryst with hell for many years, Jung Jinsu, the brain behind the New Truth, is back and recognises the growing prominence of the Arrowhead in the society. Jinsu realises he may not be the only one to be resurrected back to the land of the living. Does resurrection eventually mean damnation or will it pave the path to true salvation?

Kim Sung-Cheol, Kim Hyun-joo, Kim Shin-rock, Moon So-ri are undoubtedly the show-stealers this season, sharing equal honours, bagging morally complex characters, representing different dimensions of the human psyche. Lee Dong-hea is quite impressive as Kim, mirroring a leaderâ€™s confusions and insecurities transparently through an effective performance. Others, from Lee Dong-hea to Cho Dong-in, Yang Ik-Joon, get to make a mark as well.
