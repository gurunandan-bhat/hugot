Dabba Cartel is an intriguing mix of a desi drug syndicate gone bad and suburban drama, with an added dose of the murky world of pharma industries. But most of all, this crime drama is the story of individuals pushed to the limit even when their intentions are well-meaning. Created by Shibani Akhtar, Vishnu Menon, Gaurav Kapur, and Akanksha Seda, the Netflix series has an impressive cast that does justice to different riveting plotlines that converge at one thrilling juncture. Taking place in the nondescript VivaLife Society in Thane, the so-called drug business starts off small and clandestine until it snowballs into something that has deadly consequences for all involved. There's another layer of a pharma company covering up their involvement in the distribution of a lethal painkiller. Woven into this are the stories of men and women aiming for a better life, from a couple hoping to migrate to Germany to a maid wanting her young daughter to have nicer things. However, greed and ambition catch up with them, leaving them at a crossroads.
