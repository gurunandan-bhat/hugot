Captain America took on a new face back in 2021 with the release of The Falcon And The Winter Solider. Sam Wilson decided not to go through the same treatment as Steve Rogers to become a Super Solider and this is about him and fans doubting his decision. It still feels like a good idea for Wilson to take the serum but he won’t in the coming years to justify the ideology — which the film does on more than one occasion even when the decision feels like a bad idea to our new Cap himself. The film does bring in some familiar faces for cameos which makes the second half worthwhile, but it doesn't build up to much. The film’s plot remains wafer thin as the government’s high-level prisoner goes rouge (surprise-surprise) and ends up taking over anyone and everyone he wishes including the President. While the tech may already be a real thing IRL, the film fails to see how a prisoner as big as the one introduced in the film gets away with it without raising any red flags or real alarms. Meanwhile, Sam returns to the MCU as the saviour of USA by going on a mission to retrieve a secret package being sold on the down low. And President Ross is working on trying to get the USA some Adamantium found in the celestial island aka Tiamut's body left behind by the Eternals.
