In the early 1970s, a series of murders left the residents of Manvat terrorized, and people of Maharashtra in shock. A small town in Parbhani district, Manvat saw people, mostly women, being killed over a span of about two years with a black magic ritualistic motive, as the cops would later find out. Ashish Bende’s series attempts to take a deep dive into the case through the eyes of late cop Ramakant Kulkarni’s lens. Manvat Murders is based on Kulkarni’s book Footprints on the Sand of Time, which documented his high-profile cases, including the Manvat case which he was assigned.

Fresh from the acclaim for Aatmapamphlet, Bende makes his foray into the OTT space with this 8-episode series that boasts of a stellar cast. Ashutosh Gowariker plays Ramakant Kulkarni and the likes of Sonali Kulkarni, Makarand Anaspure, Sai Tamhankar, Kishore Kadam and Umesh Jagtap appear in pivotal roles in Manvat Murders. With these actors, one is bound to expect powerful performances and they do deliver.
