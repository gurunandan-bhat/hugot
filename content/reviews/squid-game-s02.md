After its premiere in 2021, it was easy to see why Squid Game became the most popular show in the world. Writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk's universal story of greed and betrayal, which exposed humanity's basest behaviour, struck a chord globally. Audiences took to the characters created in this universe and mourned as we lost several fan favourites who were treated as pawns in the deadly contest based on nostalgic children's games. The show returns after three years and a time jump, as the last winner Seong Gi-hun decides to infiltrate the games to take it down. Lee Jung-jae's Gi-hun is a much-changed man this season as he's on a mission to dismantle the games. Plagued with guilt about his survival after his friends didn't make it, he wants to save others from succumbing to the same fate. But his plan faces plenty of hurdles that he doesn't anticipate. The Front Man (Lee Byung-hun), the overseer of the game, has a bigger role than last season, and police officer Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-joon) also returns to find his way back to find out more about the mysterious organisation that runs the games.
