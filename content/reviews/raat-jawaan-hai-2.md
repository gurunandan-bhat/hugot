It's been a while since we've seen a comedy that you can see yourself in. SonyLIV's Raat Jawaan Hai focuses on a trio of friends who are there for each other through thick and thin. Developed by Khyati Anand-Puthran and Sumeet Vyas, the series features very real characters, the kind of people you've met in life. Backed by a solid cast who deliver genuine performances, Raat Jawaan Hai is the feel-good watch for this month, nay, this year!

Radhika (Anjali Anand), Avinash (Barun Sobti) and Suman (Priya Bapat) have remained friends since school. Now as adults balancing marriage, parenthood and other responsibilities, they still manage to find time for one another. In fact, it is their friendship that allows them get through other aspects of their crowded lives. The story moves between simple things like finding time to watch a movie to more complicated ones like getting the gang, their partners and children together for a weekend away. Through the eight episodes, the three friends rely on each other more and more.
