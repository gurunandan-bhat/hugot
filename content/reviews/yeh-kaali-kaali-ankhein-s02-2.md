In January 2022, the Netflix series Yeh Kaali Kaali Ankhein introduced us to an unusual drama. The show, set in a small town, revolved around Vikrant (Tahir Raj Bhasin), who uncomfortably finds himself to be the object of affection for a gangster politician's daughter Purva (Aanchal Singh). Instead of marrying his college sweetheart Shikha (Shweta Tripathi), he finds himself tied by matrimony to someone he doesn't love. Sidharth Sengupta's series took Vikrant to his limit as he found himself hiring a hitman to get rid of Purva. Now, nearly three years later, the series returns to pick up where it left off.

The second season is the next chapter in the tale focused entirely on Purva's kidnapping and the aftermath. The hitman (Arunoday Singh) demands a ransom, and soon everyone is involved. The new entrant to the series Guru (Gurmeet Choudhary) is a super spy who sees and knows all. So how does Vikrant manage to escape unscathed from this mess? The chess pieces move in the show, but they don't go very far.
