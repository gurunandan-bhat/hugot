Movies can shape us in silly but significant ways. Growing up in the 1990s, for instance, I developed an irrational and premature fear of foreign travel. This had little to do with any growing awareness of geopolitical realities and everything to do with a schlocky Bollywood film starring Sridevi and Sanjay Dutt. Directed by Mahesh Bhatt, Gumrah (1993) — a jailbreak drama set between Mumbai and Hong Kong — was shivery B-movie fun, and it left me with an enduring anxiety. If I clutched my cabin luggage a little too cautiously on my first international flight, nervously looking over my shoulders, I had Bhatt and the duplicitous face of Rahul Roy to thank.

I doubt Vasan Bala’s Jigra, a modern reskin of Gumrah, also produced by Dharma Productions and featuring Bhatt’s daughter Alia in the lead role, will have the same effect on the current generation of movie-goers. Despite its sheen of competence, it lacks the spine-chilling impact of great arrested-abroad films, like Alan Parker’s frequently racist yet effective Midnight Express (1978). (On that note, in an era of travel influencers and affordable itineraries, not to mention a glut of true-crime documentaries and podcasts on the perils of globetrotting, are fictional narratives losing their cautionary force?)
