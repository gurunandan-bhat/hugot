The promo promised entertainment around the missing CD of a video shot by a couple on its first night. Written and directed by Raaj Shaandilyaa, the promo stirred a strong pre-release buzz. The sense of fun does spill into the first few scenes as glib-talking mehndiwala Vicky (Rajkummar Rao) stages a scene at the engagement of his girlfriend Vidya (Triptii Dimri). It ends the way Vicky and Vidya had planned it with her lawyer-fiancé walking off in a huff and the man who applied mehndi at functions, stepping in to marry his girl.

Raaj gets it right at the first round by casting the hero in the rare character of a mehndiwala and sets the tone for humour with the fiancé (Manjot Singh) being called a “mini Sidhu” along with a few cracks at the “honhaar lawyer”. When the fiancé stomps off, swearing that he’ll marry even the naukrani but not Vidya, the house-help called Chanda steps forward hopefully.

The premise of a couple making a CD of its first night intimacy, a thief sneaking in and stealing several items including the CD that’s still in the recorder, and Vicky-Vidya running helter-skelter to retrieve the CD before it’s viewed publicly, is fertile ground for a lot of fun.
