Every viewing of Shuchi Talati's excellent Girls will be Girls, produced by Richa Chadha, will probably elicit a different response. The coming-of-age film focused on a mother and daughter is tender, moving and nuanced. The period story is set around a boarding school where rules and regulations reign supreme. But through them, these women break free, to live a little.

The film introduces us to Mira Kishore (Preeti Panigrahi) just as she has been named Head Prefect. The 16-year-old is a model student and a stickler for rules, and eventually we'll see how the pressure eventually gets to her. Mira is intrigued by new student Srinivas (Kesav Binoy Kiron), eventually forming a romantic relationship with him, under her mother Anila's (Kani Kusruti) watchful eyes. Over time, both Mira and Anila's relationship with Sri changes, and brings them both to a breaking point.
