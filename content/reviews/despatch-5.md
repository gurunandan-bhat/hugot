Crime reporter Joy Bag (Manoj Bajpayee) is not the kind of journalist we see too often in Hindi movies. His favourite accompaniment is his rucksack, as he goes about criss-crossing the city on his bike, in search of the latest story. He’s been doing this for a while, because he talks to his seniors like an equal, but at heart he will always remain a scrappy newshound who likes nothing better than chatting up shadowy contacts over cups of cheap cutting chai, which he prefers to the pizza his wife serves at unwelcome parties at home.

Director Kanu Behl’s sharp exploration of the ugly, sordid aspects of life made his debut feature ‘Titli’ a riveting watch, in which a criminal family on the margins of Delhi tries to eke a living with varying degrees of success. Behl’s manner of probing the standard construct of masculinity, and the damage stuntedness can lead to, was the most interesting part of his not-as-accomplished film, ‘Agra’.
