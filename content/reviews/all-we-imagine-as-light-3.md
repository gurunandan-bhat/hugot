A woman leans on a pole in her compartment, for support, for balance, swaying with the rhythm of the train. She looks exhausted, after a long day at work. We take in, like she does, the way the city looks at night, bars of refracted light and darkness dancing across her face. This image, which comes early in Payal Kapadia’s lyrical ode to working-class Mumbai and female friendship, becomes a marker of the themes the film explores, and it stays with you.

I watched the film at its first screening at the Cannes Film Festival in May, where it won the Grand Prix award, wowing some of the world’s most hard-nosed critics. Those of us who had seen her earlier work, especially the striking documentary ‘A Night Of Knowing Nothing’, based on the student agitation at the director’s alma mater, the FTII (Film and Television Institute of India), knew that her debut feature would be far removed from the Indian exotica that appeals, still, to so much of the West. In many ways, I found several similarities between the documentary and the feature, which builds on the promise that Kapadia has shown, making her one of the most original filmmakers working today.
