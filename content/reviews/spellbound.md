Skydance Animation's second film, Spellbound, updates family dynamics in a modern way, letting kids know that sometimes happily ever after doesn't work out. Shrek director Vicky Jensen helms this refreshing but overlong story of a teenage girl trying to undo a spell on her parents that has turned them into literal monsters. The colourfully appealing but flat world of Lumbria makes way for a quest for the royal trio in this well-meaning musical.

Time is running out for 15-year-old Princess Ellian (voice of Rachel Zegler), as she must find a way to help her father King Solon (voice of Javier Bardem) and mother Queen Ellsmere (voice of Nicole Kidman). The teenager, who doesn't want to become queen herself so soon, takes her parents on a daring quest to reverse the spell's effects before her parents become monsters forever. Through the medium of music and magic, the family finds their way back to one another again.
