‘Baby John’ has all the trappings of a mass entertainer, having been produced by Atlee, the record-maker ‘Jawan’ director whose remake of Tamil film ‘Their’ it is. Headlined by a fairly bankable star, Varun Dhawan, who can certainly act, he does try to energise the proceedings. South Indian sensation Keerthy Suresh is making her Bollywood debut and yesterday’s ‘Hero’ Jackie Shroff plays the vilest of vile badman. On the side is the beautiful and talented Wamiqa Gabbi.

Yet, as ‘Baby John’ goes on and on, often all over the place, it ends up as a trap. Yes, the start is kind of cute. A father-daughter jodi, John (Varun Dhawan) and his precocious daughter Khushi’s (Zara Zyanna) bonding is so sugar saccharine sweet, it would even put the ‘Hum Saath Saath Hain’ Rajshree variant of family bonhomie to shame. But mind you, this is no family drama. Varun is not here to just play daddy dearest, but is a man of action, even though the opening rushes will have you believe that he is not a man of violence.
