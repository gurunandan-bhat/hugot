Two early scenes in Despatch provide a foretaste of the complexities that are about to assail the life of crime reporter Joy Bag (Manoj Bajpayee). In the first, he returns home from a long day at work to find wife Shweta (Shahana Goswami) merrily partying with friends. One of the guests, drunk to the gills, tries to forcibly feed him a pizza. Joy snaps and storms out of the house.

In the other sequence, the protagonist gets into a punch-up with a small-time gangster who he tries to pin down and extract information from. The criminal is nabbed by a cop but not he has given the investigative journalist a bloodied nose.
