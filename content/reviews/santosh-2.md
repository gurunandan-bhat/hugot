Documentarian Sandhya Suri's feature debut, Santosh, revolves around a widow who is trying to find her feet after her husband's untimely death. The simple narrative evolves into a more complex police procedural that will leave you unsettled by the end of it. Starring Shahana Goswami and Sunita Rajwar, Santosh had its world premiere in the Un Certain Regard section at the Cannes Film Festival this year. It is also the UK's official Oscar entry for Best International Feature for 2025.

After her husband, a constable, is killed while maintaining the peace during a riot-like situation, Santosh Saini (Goswami) takes up his position on compassionate grounds. The widow, trying to maintain independence away from her parents and ungrateful in-laws, steps up where needed. She soon learns on the job when to keep silent, when to lie, and when to accept a bribe. However, during the murder investigation of a young Dalit girl named Devika, Santosh finds herself a little in over her head.
