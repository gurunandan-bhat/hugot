A couple of corpses disappear from a morgue. Police officer Amiya (Gaurab Chakrabarty) and his team start investigating. They learn about a little stinky monster, Genu, who reminds him of an old story. Amiya and Titas (Anindita Bose) remember that their old friend Sanjay (Anujoy Chatterjee) told them a story of a similar monster 10 years ago and both the descriptions match. That’s when Amiya seeks help from Bhaduri Moshai (Chiranjeet Chakraborty).

Will Nikosh Chaya have you sleeping with your lights on? Perhaps not. But it is still a show that will send some chills down your spine. In a space that has pitiful low scary content, Parambrata’s body horror Nikosh Chhaya is surely a fair effort.
