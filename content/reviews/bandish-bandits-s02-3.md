In our autograph books way back in school, a favourite verse was, “East is East, West is West. When they meet, it’s the best.” Bandish Bandits makes the same point, embellishing it with blended, mood-elevating music. There’s usually an ambience-fatigue when a fresh premise goes into a second season and struggles to say something new. Kota Factory, Mirzapur, Undekhi and Aarya are prime examples of ambience-fatigue.

Anand Tiwari who writes, creates and directs, manages to duck the syndrome even as he continues to root for the Rathod gharana in Rajasthan while exploring new locations like Himachal Pradesh. With successor Radhe (Ritwik Bhowmik), opponent Digvijay (Atul Kulkarni), parents Mohini (Sheeba Chadha) and Rajendra (Rajesh Tailang) and on-off girlfriend Tamanna (Shreya Chaudhry) in their respective roles, new entrants, mentor Nandini Singh (Divya Dutta), students Ayaan (Rohan Gurbaxani) and Soumya (Yashaswini
Dayama), plus poet Imroz (Arjun Rampal), add their own musical notes to the main theme.
