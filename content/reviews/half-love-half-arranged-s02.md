Riya’s household has a new guest – Ved, son of her father’s close friend Dinesh. As the family gradually adapts to his presence at the house, Riya is desperate to stabilise her relationship with the divorcee Jogi. She finds a new friend in Ved, also her secret admirer. Meanwhile, aunt Rajjo is all set to enter wedlock with a neighbour but Riya is as confused as ever about her relationships.

Maanvi Gagroo is an actor who’s consistently proved her worth in recent years in the digital medium. Honestly, a show like Half Love Half Arranged is a walk in the park for her, for it’s too basic to test her mettle. Karan Wahi, in addition to his good looks, wins your attention while he lasts, though his role is poorly fleshed out.
