Avee Sharma, a sexologist, is traumatised after breaking up with Shruti at the cusp of marriage. While he gradually comes to terms with it, he indulges in a no-strings-attached relationship with a patient – a married woman Rekha. Later, he falls for a neighbour Nikita. However, she hides a secret from her life that could derail their equation. Meanwhile, Rajat, a psychologist, opens him to a new perspective towards love.

Smaran Sahu is a breath of fresh air, he brings an undeniable masculine appeal to the portrayal of Avee Sharma and plays his part with warmth, helping the viewer look at him from a place of empathy (despite a few of his problematic choices). Deepika Amin pulls off the cool mom-act with elegance and leaves behind a lasting impression, while Pawan Chopra is impressive as the psychologist Rajat. Bhakti Kubavat has a terrific screen presence (as Nikita) and so do the actors playing the other spunky women in Avee’s colourful life – Gurpreet Kaur, Bhumika Barot and Harshita Sahu. Devang Tanna is another impressive find (as Mohit) though Jay Wadhwani’s Denis is not so memorable.
