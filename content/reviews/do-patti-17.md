Do Patti begins with scattered shots of paragliding gone wrong and a stakeout on a bridge, followed by a woman in a police station telling the cops her husband tried to kill her. Phir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba, released in August, also has a stakeout on a bridge, and its first scene is a woman in a police station telling the cops her husband is going to kill her. Both films are written by Kanika Dhillon, both are Netflix releases. Did no one think it was a problem that the films start the exact same way?

Vidya Jyothi (Kajol) is a cop in Devipur, a sleepy Uttarakhand town. She’s dying for some excitement, which explains her latching on to a domestic violence case. Saumya (Kriti Sanon) has a bruise on her forehead and the neighbours heard what sounded like her husband, Dhruv (Shaheer Sheikh), assaulting her. But she won’t press charges—not yet at least. The next day, Vidya meets Saumya at a gift store, only it’s her twin, Shailee (also Sanon).
