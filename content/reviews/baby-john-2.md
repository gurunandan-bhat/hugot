You know a movie is on shaky grounds when you find yourself agreeing with a sidekick who scoffs at the hero's swagger, 'Kahe ka Bachchan? Machhar aaya hai. Massal daal.' Truth be told, Varun Dhawan's good egg energy makes it hard to buy him as an indomitable hulk single-handedly taking on a battalion of goons and serving justice without worrying about the consequences. The amount of loud music and dramatic mood (rain, thunder, fire) gone in to make the actor look formidable is telling enough of how unsuitable he's for the job. Directed by his assistant Kalees, Baby John is a scene-to-scene remake of Atlee's Tamil hit, Theri with a couple of inconsequential tweaks and a superstar cameo that didn't do anything for Singham Again and doesn't do anything for this one either. Even if you haven't watched Theri, which is purely fan service for Vijay fans, you wouldn't miss out on anything. There's no dearth of potboilers recycling the same old masala over the decades.
