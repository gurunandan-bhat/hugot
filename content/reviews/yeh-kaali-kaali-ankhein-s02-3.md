The first season of ‘Yeh Kaali Kaali Aankhein’ became an addictive watch in the way it bent one of the oldest genres in the book: being an obsessive lover is not just a male prerogative; women can do it just as well, if not better. It made up for all its nods to hoary Hindi movie heavies who lived in palaces overrun by armed goons, governed by old-style off-with-their-heads villainy.

Director Sidharth Sengupta and co-writers Anahata Menon and Varun Badola return with their cast and commitment intact for season 2. Purva’s (Aanchal Singh) fixation with childhood crush Vikrant (Tahir Raj Bhasin), which set things into motion in the previous season, has multiplied manifold. Her loving daddy Akheraj Awasthi (Saurabh Shukla), a local power centre, has grown more powerful in the interim: whatever his princess wants, she will get.
