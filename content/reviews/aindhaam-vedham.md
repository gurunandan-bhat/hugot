Anu heads to Varanasi to immerse her mother’s ashes in Ganga. During the trip, she meets a sage, who hands over an ancient relic to her and dies under mysterious circumstances. Though Anu is instructed to give it to a temple priest in a village, she is reluctant to take the initiative. What connects her to the relic, an ancient temple and the fifth veda?

Sai Dhanshika needs no introduction as a worthy performer and has been around for long in the Tamil industry but it’s surprising why her roles and projects barely do justice to her credentials. Though she gets a full-length role in Aindhaam Vedham, it is poorly etched to offer any scope for a winning performance. Santhosh Prathap is strictly okay in an inconsequential role.
