After a shortened season earlier this year due to the Hollywood strikes, Abbott Elementary is back on schedule with a full season. This time, the teachers' gang at the Philadelphia school convene for a new school year with plenty of hijinks. The biggest change this season is that the perennial will-they, won't-they couple Janine (Quinta Brunson) and Gregory (Tyler James Williams) have made it official. But what does this mean for the rest of the season? Let's find out!

Aside from the Janine-Gregory romance, there's a new development outside the school. A new golf course is being built near the school, disrupting their daily routines. The construction work cuts off the water and gas at Willard R Abbott Elementary School. But the biggest change is that the school gets its first white student. Principal Ava Coleman's (Janelle James) reaction to this is hilarious. While this golf course obstacle might last for a few episodes, fans are really interested to see how Janine and Gregory deal with being boyfriend and girlfriend this season.
