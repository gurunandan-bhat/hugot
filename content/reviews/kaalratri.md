Devi (Soumitrisha), who only remembers the past six years of her life, gets married to Rudra Roy Burman (Indrasish Roy) &mdash; a drunkard and lecherous son of Samaresh Roy Burman (Debesh Chattopadhyay). Devi’s mysterious friend Maya (Koushani Mukherjee) &mdash; known for her ominous presence &ndash; predicts that Rudra will die the next day after their marriage. Her prediction becomes real.
