In the 1980s and 90s, we had a steady stream of films about an outsider coming to a broken home, and uniting everyone. Visu almost perfected this template. We saw it happen in the 90s and 2000s too where the setting of the home was extended to a college, a workplace, a village, etc… Basically, Indian cinema loves its feel-good family entertainer space where there are clashes of ego, but all’s well that ends well. There was a time when M Rajesh could effectively milk these situations, and effortlessly conjure hilarious scenes with his oddball protagonists. There was a time when he soared past the generic nature of the central plot, and neatly wrapped it all up with his brand of comedy. Unfortunately, hardly any of this happens in his latest film Brother.

On a rather simplistic level, Brother is about Karthi (Jayam Ravi), who plays an extension of his conscientious character from Nimirndhu Nil. Despite saying the right things and abiding by the law, he runs into hot water with everyone around, who seem to be comfortable cutting corners. After one issue too many, he is packed off to Ooty to spend time with his sister Anandhi’s (Bhumika) family. In the next scene, we see his sister’s sister-in-law Archana (Priyanka Mohan) get all googly-eyed around him. Why? We will cut to a song in a moment. But before that, we are introduced to the oddball characters of his sister’s in-laws. There’s her father-in-law and district collector Sivagurunathan (Rao Ramesh), who has a bloated ego, and a misplaced superiority complex. There’s her mother-in-law and advocate Hemamalini (Saranya Ponvannan), who prefers speaking English and is an animal rights activist. There’s her husband and forest officer Aravind (Natty), who is selfish and a daddy’s boy. Then, yeah, there’s Archana, who is a doctor. And now, we go for the song.
