The show fits right into the style of Raj and DK sans the comedy, the rawness and the drama will keep you hooked for a while. Set in the 90s and early 2000s it focuses on the lack of technology and old-school espionage. Its sequences set in the 90s will remind audiences of old movies like the action remains grounded to today’s time. The makers find a good mix of old aesthetics, cinematography and modern writing for spy thrillers. The show has ups and downs, but performances like that of Kay Kay Menon will bring you back to the story.

Honey Bunny begins in the 90s and follows an aspiring actress Honey who has the looks and talent but fails to follow the rules of the game to stay and succeed in the industry. She loses her job to others who do play the game, and her house to someone who can pay the rent. On the other hand, Bunny is enjoying his life as a stuntman and the secret life of an agent. To help Honey out, he offers her a new job to play as a decoy on their mission but it goes south almost costing her, her life.
