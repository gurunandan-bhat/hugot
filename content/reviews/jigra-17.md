Will the real 'Jigra' please stand up? In Vasant Bala's film, Vedang Raina might be portraying the titular character, but it's Alia Bhatt, who is the heart and soul of the film. Turns out she is a shield not just for her brother, but also for the movie, even as the revenge thriller rests too heavily on Bhatt.

Here's a girl who had to grow up a little sooner than you'd like. She lost her mother when she was young and her father took his own life. It's now on her to parent her brother Ankur. The two siblings are taken in by a relative family - while Satya works as a staff in their home, Ankur is an engineer with an idea waiting to be pitched to his uncle. All through it, Satya is the one who looks out for Ankur and wants to protect him from all the evils of the world. But fate had other plans. Ankur lands up in jail in a foreign land (a fictional Hanshi Dao) on false charges of drug possession. The clock is ticking as the court pronounces the death penalty for Ankur. It's a race against time for Satya who can now go to any lengths to free her younger brother or as she calls him, her 'jigra'.
