The deep bonds between a horse and their human have been at the centre of many wonderful films. Azaad, which has two men, senior and junior, vying for the affections of a beautiful beast, should have been double the fun. But this one, which launches Ajay Devgn’s nephew Aaman and Raveena Tandon’s daughter Rasha, turns out to be so dated that it appears to have been made in a time lag. First off, the setting has been lifted from ‘Lagaan’– cruel zamindars helping pompous Englishmen lord over cowed villagers — with the addition of a few floggings, and loud proclamations of banishing the villagers to ‘Africa’ as bonded labour.
