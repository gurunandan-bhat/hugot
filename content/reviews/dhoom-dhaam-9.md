The new Valentine's Day comedy, Dhoom Dhaam, covers a lot of ground. It's an awkward romance about a couple set up via arranged marriage, a thriller about crooked law enforcement officials, and comedy set mostly over one night in Mumbai. Directed by Rishab Seth, the Hindi film has several twists and turns, most of which we can guess. The narrative follows a pretty standard formula of complete opposites thrown together in a relationship; in this case, it's a quick wedding. Yami Gautam and Pratik Gandhi, playing roles we've seen them take on before, still manage to create a substantial chemistry in an entertaining manner.
