Making movies is a serious business. But in the Apple TV+ series, The Studio, co-created by Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Peter Huyck, Alex Gregory, and Frida Perez, seeing the behind-the-scenes decisions on how movies get sanctioned is very funny business indeed. Rogen is Matt Remick, who is bumped up as the head of Continental Studios, and has to prove himself over and over as he tries to do what he loves the most, make movies. The clever and biting satire lifts the lid on awards ceremonies, industry parties, and of course, the deals that go into making sure the movies get sanctioned in the first place. Corporate CEO Griffin Mill, played by the excellent Bryan Cranston in a guest appearance, promotes Matt Remick as top boss and sets some unreasonable expectations on him. The movie-loving executive has some tough decisions to make from here on, most of which he fumbles badly. Like most studios, Matt must launch a franchise based on a nostalgic brand like Barbie, and watching him and his team put together a film on Kool-Aid is downright hilarious. Even more cringeworthy are Matt's interactions with people who make movies; he has a desperate need to be liked. At times when absolutely everything goes wrong, he and his team manage to hold it through.
