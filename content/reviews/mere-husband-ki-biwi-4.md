Between done-to-death tropes and flimsily updated ones, Mere Husband Ki Biwi sticks to ancient formulae yet gives a semblance of keeping up with the times only to confirm that old habits die hard. In Mudassar Aziz's routine rom-com, a divorcee dangles between his fiery ex and doting fianc√©e sparking off a battle for one-upmanship. It starts like a cheesy David Dhawan comedy salvaged by Govinda's inimitable lunacy back in the day and advances into a My Best Friend's Wedding rehash sans the deliciousness of Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz's jell-o pitted against creme brulee. Except this return to the 1990s style of whimsy evokes more nausea than nostalgia with its drab humour and out of sync performances.
