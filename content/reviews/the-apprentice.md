The Apprentice is one of the film that no one asked for but now that its here you can't look away from it. The direction, cinematography, lighting, sets and most of all the performances all are worth praising but the film majorly avoids taking sides. For first half it makes you like Trump and for the other the pre-existing hate returns, so it doesn't really add to his public narrative, the reason for its existence left questioning. But the film is worth the watch for its art.

The film begins with the embodiment of what talking to Donald Trump must feeling like, watch him obsess over successful people and what their life and influential existence is like. Trump takes his date to a members only place to shows off all the people he hangs out with, to show off him being the youngest member of the club but he doesn't fit in. Trumo doesn't quite fit in even after crossing paths with Roy Cohn.
While Trump's father is being investigated by federal government for discrimination against African-American tenants Cohn eventually offers to help and in turn also takes Donald into his wing.
