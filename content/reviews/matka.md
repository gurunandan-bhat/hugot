How does a business venture that does not require much investment work, a character wonders in director Karuna Kumar’s Telugu film Matka. We sell hope and buy people’s trust, explains the protagonist (Varun Tej as Vasu) whose character is inspired by gambler Ratan Khatri, also known as the ‘matka’ king. His statement and the scenes on a train that precede it, showing the potential for gambling and how it can turn ordinary citizens into addicts, perk up an otherwise predictable narrative.

Khatri is known to have initiated matka, a game of gambling as a spin-off of the bets traders used to place on cotton trade each day. The game became popular throughout India and is said to have had ramifications on the economy in the 1970s. A fiction inspired by the story of this ‘matka’ king, treated like a biopic, holds tremendous scope for drama, a discussion of good versus evil, with characters that switch sides for personal and political gains.
