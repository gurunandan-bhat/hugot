Symbolism in art is inherently indirect, but in Prithviraj Sukumaran’s Empuraan it is thrown at your face, one ‘L’ at a time, to remind us of the omnipotent anti-hero Lucifer. Part of a broken cross atop a rundown church falls down, landing in slow motion as an ‘L’. Later, a burning tree branch falls perfectly as an ‘L’. If the ‘L’eft bottom corner of the screen were ‘L’it up, one could have savoured an ‘L’ for the whole ‘L’ength of the film. Part of Empuraan’s many problems lies in this over-reliance on the internationally notorious, shadowy figure of Khureshi Ab’raam aka Lucifer while relegating his local avatar Stephen Nedumpally (Mohanlal), the central figure of the first part, to a mere guest appearance. Now, Lucifer (2019) was a flawed film which in its post-release afterlife was turned into the holy grail of Malayalam commercial filmmaking, although it pales in comparison with the best of commercial entertainers of the 1980s and 90s. Yet, it had something going for it. Empuraan has hardly anything going for it, except for the richness of its production design.
