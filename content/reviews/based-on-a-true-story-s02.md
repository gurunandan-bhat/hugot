Comedies that mock America's inexplicable obsession with true crime and especially podcasts are on the rise. The new season of Peacock's Based on a True Story, starring Kaley Cuoco and Chris Messina, brings back their suburban couple, Ava and Nathan Bartlett, who thought unmasking a serial killer would make them famous. By the end of Season 2, the duo become more infamous thanks to their curiosity about a new copycat serial killer. The comedy is still funny and insightful even as it takes its time to surprise the characters and audience with new twists.

Ava (Cuoco) and Nathan (Messina) are now overtired parents to baby Jack, but parenthood has not made the couple wiser. Even Matt, aka Westside Ripper (Tom Bateman) from Season 1, has seemingly turned a new leaf and deepened his relationship with Ava's sister Tory (Liana Liberato). However, Ava and Nathan are still searching for that elusive high they get when investigating a case, and this time around, it may prove to be too much for them to handle.
