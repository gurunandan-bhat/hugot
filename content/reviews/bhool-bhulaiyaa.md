Sometimes, a film takes off with an unpredictably thoughtful ending. The beginning and the middle get written to lead up to it. Director Anees Bazmee and writer Aakash Kaushik seem to have had an unexpected climax in mind before they sat down to take the audience through a maze, keeping alive the question, “Who’s Manjulika?” With the return of Vidya Balan (Mallika) to the franchise, the entry of Madhuri Dixit (Mandira) and the tussle between them, the guessing game goes on.

When fake exorcist Ruhan Randhawa who styles himself as Rooh Baba (Kartik Aaryan) lands up in the haunted haveli where Manjulika has been locked up, an ancient story is narrated. Manjulika, daughter of the Maharaja of Raktghat, was the gifted one, unerringly accurate in hitting her target. But when her father had named her young half-brother as his heir, her intense jealousy had awakened to kill her sibling. She was burnt at the stake as a punishment but Manjulika’s thirst for revenge had brought her back to haunt the palace. She had to be kept locked up for two centuries.
