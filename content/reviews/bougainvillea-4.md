Amal Neerad and his co-writer Lajo Jose (whose story this film is based on) know how far to push the unreliable narrator trope. Not only is their protagonist Reethu (Jyothirmayi in her return) suffering from both retrograde and anterograde amnesia, but we’re seeing the film through her perspective for the most part. What makes this film even more complex is how quickly we get the feeling that we cannot rely on the people Reethu relies on to make sense of her chilling universe.

This could be something as simple as the notebook she must read to find out everything about who she is and how she got here. Items on the kitchen shelves need names, just like how she needs to write tiny chits to keep note of all the events that make up her day. As a painter, this malfunctioning memory does not allow for her a lot of creativity. She wakes up every day, sends her children to school, and sits in front of an empty canvas to paint the same red bougainvillea again and again.

But why these same flowers? Do they represent a happy memory? Or is she just painting the red flowers that decorate the entrance to her dreamy house?
