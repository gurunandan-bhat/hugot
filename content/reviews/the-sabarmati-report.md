The communal bloodshed that tainted Gujarat in 2002 has been told and retold on film, in books, on TV debates.
But there’s been a lid on the Godhra tragedy that preceded the riots, a lid that’s lifted occasionally to put out theories that suppress and mislead more than reveal. A gas cylinder, a cigarette? What sparked the fire that roasted 59 kar sevaks including tiny children inside a bogey of the Sabarmati Express outside Godhra station in 2002?

“It was not an accident. The bogey was set on fire,” concludes Manika Rajpurohit (Riddhi Dogra), star anchor of EBT news channel. Hindi journalist Samar Kumar (Vikrant Massey) who has accompanied her to Godhra as cameraman, is therefore shocked when Manika changes the narrative before the camera – her bosses and their political puppeteers want to roast the new CM of Gujarat.
