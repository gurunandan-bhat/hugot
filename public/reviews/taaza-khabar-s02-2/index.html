    <p>In Taaza Khabar Season 2, there’s little that’s taaza (fresh). There’s ambition, but not enough drive. There are those next big things, but not the smoothest ways forward. A show, often oscillating between past, present and future, lacks the ‘vardaan’ (blessing) of staying afloat - something that, both the series and Bhuvan Bam’s character Vasant Gawde desperately need.</p>
<p>Those who’ve watched the first season will understand when we say - far bizarre things happen to Gawde in the follow-up. In the first season, a sanitation worker stumbles upon his magical powers of getting updates about future events and his life changes overnight. But everything that rises must eventually have a downfall. The new season takes off from where the last one ended - only this time, the ‘taaza khabar’ is that of Vasya dying. Will he rise from the dead? Or can he possibly avert his death?</p>
