    <p>The promo promised entertainment around the missing CD of a video shot by a couple on its first night. Written and directed by Raaj Shaandilyaa, the promo stirred a strong pre-release buzz. The sense of fun does spill into the first few scenes as glib-talking mehndiwala Vicky (Rajkummar Rao) stages a scene at the engagement of his girlfriend Vidya (Triptii Dimri). It ends the way Vicky and Vidya had planned it with her lawyer-fiancé walking off in a huff and the man who applied mehndi at functions, stepping in to marry his girl.</p>
<p>Raaj gets it right at the first round by casting the hero in the rare character of a mehndiwala and sets the tone for humour with the fiancé (Manjot Singh) being called a “mini Sidhu” along with a few cracks at the “honhaar lawyer”. When the fiancé stomps off, swearing that he’ll marry even the naukrani but not Vidya, the house-help called Chanda steps forward hopefully.</p>
<p>The premise of a couple making a CD of its first night intimacy, a thief sneaking in and stealing several items including the CD that’s still in the recorder, and Vicky-Vidya running helter-skelter to retrieve the CD before it’s viewed publicly, is fertile ground for a lot of fun.</p>
