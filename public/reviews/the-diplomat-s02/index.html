    <p>The second season of The Diplomat returns with more urgency as the US ambassador to UK, Kate Wyler, tries to uncover who is behind two terrorists attacks on British targets. The political drama is led by the excellent Keri Russell who navigates the exciting twists and turns along with the audience. Debora Cahn&rsquo;s The Diplomat gives viewers a front seat to an unfolding international crisis, where the stakes have never been higher.</p>
<p>The thriller wastes no time picking up in the aftermath of the car bomb from the Season 1 finale. As Kate (Russell) and UK Foreign Secretary Austin Dennison (David Gyasi) figure out their next step, the clues all point to the attack being an inside job. There is political chaos and panic spread over six episodes as Kate and inner circle, including her husband Hal (Rufus Sewell), a former ambassador himself, figure out their next step. But as is the case with this exhilarating show, the end result is now what you&rsquo;d expect.</p>
