    <p>In one of the many interesting segues in Rajkumar Periasamy’s Amaran, an officer talks to Major Mukund Varadarajan (an earnest Sivakarthikeyan) about the Kashimir women these officers refer to as “half widows”, stuck in perennial conflict as they wait for their husbands to return, unsure if they&rsquo;re still alive. This is explained in a rush, as though someone is reading aloud a Wikipedia entry, but one can still make a connection between these women and the film’s narrator,</p>
<p>Indhu Rebecca Varghese, played by Sai Pallavi, who has also spent her whole life waiting. Indhu is Major Mukund Varadarajan’s wife and we learn everything about him through a series of vignettes, or memories, when she travels by flight to collect his Ashoka Chakra, awarded posthumously. The tone, however, isn’t that of a tragedy and the film isn&rsquo;t viewed through the eyes of someone who has accepted defeat. She is strong and courageous, and in moments of conflict, both husband and wife feel like two sides of the same coin, which the film underscores by almost always showing them in split screen. In her words, “we’re constantly in a long distance relationship”.</p>
