    <p>28 years ago, director Shankar and Kamal Haasan gifted &lsquo;Indian&rsquo; to the Tamil audience, who still celebrate it like it&rsquo;s their own. Almost three decades later, the film (read: corruption) still remains relevant. But, Kamal Haasan and Shankar wanted to bring back Indian thatha (grandfather) aka Senapathy to brush up on all the corrupt activities that we&rsquo;ve seen so far in umpteen movies, not just in Tamil cinema but across other languages. Chitra Aravindan (Siddharth) and his three friends run a YouTube channel called &lsquo;Barking Dogs,&rsquo; which focuses on parodies and political satire. They end their calls with &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s bark!&rsquo; (If you think this is absurd, hold your horses). After realising that their videos, despite receiving lakhs of views, had little impact on the audience, the team starts a campaign called &lsquo;Come Back Indian.&rsquo; According to them, only Indian Thatha, aka Senapathy, could put an end to corruption.</p>
