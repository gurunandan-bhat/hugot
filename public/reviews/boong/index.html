    <p>Aijaz Khan’s Hamid and Danish Renzu’s Half Widow are the names that easily come to my mind when it comes to movies about husbands going missing. But both the aforementioned films have the backdrop of the political crisis in Kashmir. This is where filmmaker Lakshmipriya Devi’s Manipuri movie Boong stands apart. It is more of a personal story of a boy whose father goes missing not due to any political tensions.</p>
<p>Boong is set in a small village in Manipur, which is close to the border of Myanmar. It tells the story of a school-going kid Boong (Gugun Kipgen) and his mother Mandakini (Bala Hijam Ningthoujam). Boong’s father Joykumar (Hamom Sadananda) left for Myanmar some time back in search of work and hasn’t returned yet. He is untraceable. Mandakini is managing the household all by herself. The mother-son duo refuse to believe murmurs about his death.</p>
<p>Boong’s best friend Raju Agarwal (Angom Sanamatum) and his father Sudhir (Vikram Kochhar), whose family relocated to Manipur from Rajasthan since over a 100 years, share their pain. Circumstances ensure that Boong and Raju secretly team up to find the former’s missing father. Whether they succeed forms the rest of the story.</p>
