    <p>What sort of a spy movie is Sudhanshu Saria’s Ulajh? It begins as a Raazi (2018) in pantsuits: patriotic female protagonist, driven by loyalty and legacy, enlists to serve her country on foreign turf. Indo-Pak diplomatic relations, as fraught and fragile as they were in 1971, inform the narrative stakes. Both films hail from Junglee Pictures, and the editor, in each case, is Nitin Baid. If that weren’t enough, the new film even has a song with ‘watan’ in its title — plastered, ineffectually, over the opening credits and thereby fast forgotten.</p>
<p>It was only much later, in the closing moments of its 134-minute runtime, that Ulajh revealed its true hand. Without divulging too much, one can say that its swerve — from tense thriller to overambitious franchise-spinner — was a step in the wrong direction. It’s a particularly gruesome example of the ongoing Marvelization of Bollywood: films too distracted to stay put, floating future possibilities without successfully completing the job at hand.</p>
