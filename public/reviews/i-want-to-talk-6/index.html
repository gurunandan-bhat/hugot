    <p>In denial initially, this traumatic health crisis, numbs the pain of everything else in comparison including a broken marriage and financial downfall. What follows is countless hospital visits and an unpredictable future which tests the relationship Arjun shares with his daughter Reya.</p>
<p>Arjun is bruised not broken. There’s a certain nonchalance about Shoojit Sircar’s (Piku, October) gaze as a storyteller. It grows on you slowly and steadily. As it happens in life too, emotions are not always verbalised or expressed freely. There’s a lot of withholding and long pauses, which can be perceived as detachment or aloofness but it’s just him using silence and monotony to lead you to that breaking point. The one, you don’t see coming. There’s a certain stillness to story progression and yet you find yourself immersed in every scene.</p>
