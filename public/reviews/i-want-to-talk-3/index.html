    <p>For a man who has delivered the simplest of the stories in the most heartwarming films, Shoojit Sircar falters a bit with his latest I Want To Talk. The film, based on a real person, talks of a man&rsquo;s relentless pursuit to live despite the medical challenges that life keeps throwing at him. The film highlights the journey of Arjun Sen (Abhishek Bachchan) through years of medical misfortunes and surgeries and his constant ability to fight back. It also highlights his evolving relationship with his daughter over a few years. I Want To Talk deals with loneliness, illness and impending death - themes that Sircar has deftly handled before in films like October and Piku. But unlike the previous films, Sircar&rsquo;s latest doesn&rsquo;t leave a defining impact - despite Abhishek Bachchan delivering one of his finest performances in recent years.</p>
<p>I Want To Talk has Bachchan playing an advertising smart alec who excels at his job and thinks he is a present dad to his daughter on days he is permitted to meet her. Things turn upside down when he is diagnosed with cancer and is told he has only 100 days to live. The rest of the story of I Want To Talk has Bachchan or Arjun Sen navigating life amid multiple surgeries, a divorce, chemotherapies, ligament injuries, radiation and more. He moves houses, gets fired and starts a business of his own and contemplates suicide even as he struggles to build a connection with his daughter Reya initially.</p>
