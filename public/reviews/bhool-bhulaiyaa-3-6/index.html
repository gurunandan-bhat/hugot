    <p>Keeping with the theme of the franchise, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 also pits an unassuming cheeky protagonist against a spooky haveli with a buried past. The century-old mansion needs to be restored to its former glory and sold, but Manjulika’s terrorising presence in it forbids the owners from doing so. The royal family in dire need of resources, seeks Rooh baba’s intervention. The fraudster takes up the lucrative offer only to find himself tangled in a mess as he discovers two dark forces who claim to be Manjulika.</p>
<p>Close on the heels of Stree 2’s thumping success, comes yet another horror comedy. Anees Bazmee returns to direct BB after his 2022 hit, having taken over from Priyadarshan, who helmed the Akshay Kumar original (2007). Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 is structured more as a comedy with elements of horror. Ensemble comedies have been Bazmee’s forte (Welcome, No Entry) after all, so the departure from Priyadarshan’s psychologically tense theme is understood. A particular scene revolving around a superstar is the highlight of this film and one of its finest scenes.</p>
