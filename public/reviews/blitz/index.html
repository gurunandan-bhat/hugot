    <p>12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen takes audiences through the life of a Londoner during the German blitzkrieg of their city during World War II. The Apple TV+ feature Blitz has more of a child&rsquo;s perspective as a young boy named George escapes back to his mother after being sent away for evacuation. We see the good and bad of the times through his eyes as he loses his innocence during his misadventure.</p>
<p>Set in 1940 during the early years of the Great War, Blitz already paints a dire picture. Being bombed daily out of their homes and workplaces, Londoners tried to go about their lives. Single mom Rita (Saoirse Ronan) makes the painful decision to evacuate her 9-year-old son George (Elliott Heffernan) to the countryside. However, the defiant boy jumps the train to return home and puts himself in all sorts of trouble.</p>
