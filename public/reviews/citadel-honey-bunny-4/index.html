    <p>Is there something called an overdose of spyverse? If there is, I am one of the first victims of it. Too many spyverses are in play in pop culture and quite honestly none offer anything new. In Prime Video&rsquo;s latest series Citadel: Honey Bunny – an Indian prequel to Russo Brothers&rsquo; Citadel featuring Priyanka Chopra – the action sequences are in plenty and almost relentless yet seem repetitive. Raj &amp; DK have spoiled us with The Family Man, a sharp series where wit and action were quick on their heels. In Citadel: Honey Bunny – the lead pair Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Varun Dhawan give their all to the action sequences and perform some awe-inspiring stunts, yet the series lacks the thrills. Mostly.</p>
<p>Set in 1992 and 2000, with a non-linear narrative, Citadel: Honey Bunny begins with Samantha fighting goons double her size. She and her daughter Nadia (Kashvi Majmundar) are on the run from men who have a connection with Honey&rsquo;s (Samantha) past. In the 1990s, Honey, an aspiring actress, had befriended stuntman Bunny on a film set. She is soon inducted into a surveillance agency by &lsquo;agent&rsquo; Bunny. The agency is run by &lsquo;Baba&rsquo; (Kay Kay Menon) and Bunny seems to be the leader of the motley pack of agents, leading a covert operation where a device needs to be stolen from a scientist at a convention in Belgrade.</p>
