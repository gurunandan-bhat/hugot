    <p>The face-off between tradition and modernity, past and present, the strict rules of gharana-and-parampara vs doing-your-own-thing, which were the key notes of the first season of ‘Bandish Bandits’, are back again in the second. As are many of the actors, reprising their roles, along with new faces, as the story takes off from where it left off, back in 2020.</p>
<p>Four years is quite a gap between the two seasons, but it is reassuring to see that the show, directed by Tiwari, who has a co-writing credit with Atmika Didwania and Karan Singh Tyagi, has kept its focus on music and musicians, even as it has added new strands in the plot.</p>
