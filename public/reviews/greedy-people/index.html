    <p>Set in a small, quiet American town where nothing really happens and everyone knows everyone, Greedy People is a feature film told from many perspectives. Starring Himesh Patel, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Lily James, the crime comedy quickly moves from laughs to backstabbing, some quite literal in this crazy narrative. While the story simply must be seen to be believed, the actors&rsquo; performances sell the absurdity of the fast changing plot.</p>
<p>Himesh Patel&rsquo;s Will Shelley, a new police officer joining the force in the waterside town of Providence, South Carolina, has a truly horrific first day, which turns into an even worse week. He moves with his pregnant wife Paige (James) for a better future in the new town. But after being paired with the town menace Terry (Gordon-Levitt) as his partner, Will questions how long he can remain an officer of the law. With a dead body to cover up and plenty of cash to hide, the duo finds out that their house of cards is coming down fast.</p>
