    <p>Sanjay Gupta’s The Miranda Brothers revolves around two hunky brothers named Julio (Harshvardhan Rane) and Regalo Miranda (Meezaan Jafri), rising football stars in a Josh-coded Goa where orphaned babies are picked up from garbage dumps outside churches; arrogant cricketers cackle and say: “Cricket has two C’s: Cash and Chicks”; football scouts exclaim: “if we select both brothers, it’s like an earthquake and typhoon becoming one!”; bronze-bodied dance tracks called “Be My Mehbooba” pop up on a beach; and mourners at a funeral walk together in slow-motion as if they’re teleported to Sanjay Gupta’s Kaante (2002) instead.</p>
<p>Older bro Julio has anger issues and works for the local drug leader named Morocho (not Morocco, mind you). Regalo likes a girl named Soul, detests her abusive boyfriend, kisses her once, and then most seriously asks if he is the father when she says she’s pregnant. There’s also Julio and Regalo’s mother, Susan (Manasi Joshi Roy), who feeds her sons chorizo pao after matches, and says deep school-level thoughts like “In the end, we all become stories; we should make them memorable!” so that we know she’s going to die. Susan is a generic activist, so after she is run over by a mysterious car in front of that same church (while Regalo is trying to get his sneakers down from a wire — don’t ask), the sons react differently. Regalo wants to crack the Goa Football League (GFL) tryouts, but Julio wants cold-blooded revenge at any cost. Somehow — and I’m almost impressed with how ridiculously the film does this — a local football final will decide the fate of both brothers. The stakes: Coach Carter (Sanjay Suri, of course) promises to tell Julio who killed his mother, while Regalo is told by the GFL boss that both brothers will get contracts only if they win the final. I know, right?</p>
