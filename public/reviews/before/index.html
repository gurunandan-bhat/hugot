    <p>Billy Crystal is known for his roles that show off his comedic range like Harry Met Sally&hellip; and City Slickers. With his latest project, Before, the veteran actor is trying out a different side to his talent. He plays a grieving widower who finds purpose treating a young boy named Noah with unprocessed trauma. Written by creator Sarah Thorp, the psychological thriller delves into coincidences, fate and things science can&rsquo;t explain. The Apple TV+ has a shaky narrative that gets repetitive fast and leaves its big reveal too late.</p>
<p>Eli (Crystal) is a reputed child psychiatrist who is unable to get over his wife Lynn&rsquo;s (Judith Light) death by suicide. He finds a distraction in form of Noah Sawyer (Jacobi Jupe), a young boy in foster care. Noah goes through several stages of mental distress, with mutism, hallucinations and possibly possession. Eli and Noah are linked together through an unseen force that can help them process their personal anguishes that have building up for a long time.</p>
