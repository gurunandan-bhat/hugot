    <p>Hindi movies have played with fire several times before. Those with long memories will remember such films as the 1980 adventure ‘The Burning Train’, which may have picked up inspiration from an earlier Hollywood blockbuster ‘The Towering Inferno’, but those who fight the flames at the risk of their own lives, have never been in the limelight.</p>
<p>This is something that Rahul Dholakia’s ‘Agni’ seeks to correct. The film loses no time in placing its bets with the chief of a Mumbai fire station, Vithalrao Surve (Gandhi), who leads his band of braves from the front, as they go about dousing fires in congested buildings.</p>
