    <p>Bloody Beggar, directed by Sivabalan Muthukumar, is another bold choice by lead actor Kavin. However, it doesn’t fully deliver on its promising premise and ends up falling short in several aspects. At its core, the film struggles to find a consistent tone. It aims to be both a biting dark satire on the bourgeoisie and an emotional drama about the downtrodden, but it achieves more success with the former than the latter. The satire works to an extent, presenting exaggerated caricatures of villains who are repulsive enough to justify the violence directed at them. This offers moments of catharsis and even a few laughs at their expense. However, the emotional core surrounding the nameless beggar’s tragic past feels underdeveloped and fails to resonate in the cold, dark world of the film. Additionally, much of the humour, despite evident effort in the writing, doesn’t land as intended, making Bloody Beggar fall short of its full potential.</p>
<p>Kavin stars as a beggar who uses different ruses to evoke sympathy, pretending to be a new type of disabled person each day. One day he’s without legs, the next day he’s blind. While he enjoys small luxuries like ordering pizza and burgers, Jack, a young boy who lives with him and tries to earn an honest living by selling books, often pokes fun at his ruse. Despite Jack’s taunts, the beggar remains unapologetic and even oblivious to any guilt. Their dynamic takes a dark turn when the beggar is invited to a palace for a free feast and, in a moment of curiosity, sneaks in for a tour. Here, the beggar’s past catches up with him in an unexpected way when he witnesses a murder and is forced to impersonate the dead heir. The situation quickly turns deadly, as everyone around him is willing to kill for the inheritance.</p>
