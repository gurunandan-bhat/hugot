    <p>It&rsquo;s been 20 years since the last Wallace &amp; Gromit feature film, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. And this follow-up does not disappoint, largely due to the reappearance of the greatest villain in the franchise, Feather McGraw. Yes, that dastardly silent penguin is back, and he wants revenge on the duo that sent him to jail all those years ago. Will he succeed? Not if Gromit has his way. With Nick Park back as co-director, Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl is a funny, delightful romp in the neighbourhood. Wallace&rsquo;s newest invention in the film is a Norbot, a smart gnome robot ready to help poor Gromit around the house. Even when he doesn&rsquo;t need any help. What the pair don&rsquo;t realise that someone&rsquo;s got their eye on them, all the way from jail, as the quick-witted penguin has been biding his time, waiting to get back at Wallace for turning him into the authorities in the 1993 short film The Wrong Trousers for attempting to steal the Blue Diamond. Soon, Wallace and his trusty dog Gromit are evading the police, who believe he might be the recent spate of neighbourhood robberies.</p>
