    <p>Fortune favours the brave – this is a slogan that aptly encapsulates what Lucky Baskhar is. Director Venky Atluri’s latest outing, far different from his previous offerings, is this year’s Diwali gift to the audience. Lucky Baskhar is a film about how a middle-class man, who aims for the sky, gets derailed due to greed, but is clever enough to pull him out of the mess. Sounds interesting, doesn’t it? Baskhar (Dulquer Salmaan) is a cashier in Magadha Bank. He is the sole breadwinner of his family, which consists of his wife Sumathi (Meenakshi Chaudhary), son Karthik (Rithvik), his ailing dad, brother and sister. They’re on the edge of poverty and debts strangle him. At that time, Anthony (Ramki), a man who wants a loan from Baskhar’s bank, comes up with an offer that he can’t refuse due to his familial circumstances.</p>
