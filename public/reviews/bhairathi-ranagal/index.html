    <p>Shivarajkumar&rsquo;s portrayal of Bhairathi Ranagal in the 2017 movie Mufti was a monumental success. His iconic look—featuring coloured khadi vestis and shirts—became a trendsetter, even inspiring Nandamuri Balakrishna&rsquo;s style in Veera Simha Reddy. It&rsquo;s no surprise that the filmmakers were tempted to delve deeper into the character and cater to the audience&rsquo;s appetite for more. After all, the market rarely gets it wrong, right? Fast forward seven years and director Narthan brings us Bhairathi Ranagal, the origin story of this beloved character.</p>
<p>Bhairathi Ranagal follows a familiar narrative pattern. Set in the fictional Ronapura, the story explores Ranagal&rsquo;s transformation from a determined villager to a feared gangster. Ronapura is a remote village grappling with severe water scarcity. Ranagal, like his father, petitions government officials for help, only to face apathy. After a tipping-point incident, his patience gives way to righteous moral rage.</p>
