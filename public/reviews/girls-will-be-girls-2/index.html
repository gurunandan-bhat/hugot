    <p>Every viewing of Shuchi Talati&rsquo;s excellent Girls will be Girls, produced by Richa Chadha, will probably elicit a different response. The coming-of-age film focused on a mother and daughter is tender, moving and nuanced. The period story is set around a boarding school where rules and regulations reign supreme. But through them, these women break free, to live a little.</p>
<p>The film introduces us to Mira Kishore (Preeti Panigrahi) just as she has been named Head Prefect. The 16-year-old is a model student and a stickler for rules, and eventually we&rsquo;ll see how the pressure eventually gets to her. Mira is intrigued by new student Srinivas (Kesav Binoy Kiron), eventually forming a romantic relationship with him, under her mother Anila&rsquo;s (Kani Kusruti) watchful eyes. Over time, both Mira and Anila&rsquo;s relationship with Sri changes, and brings them both to a breaking point.</p>
