    <p>There is not a single subtle bone in Singham Again&rsquo;s action-packed, slo-mo loving body. While over-the-top has always been the signature of not only the Singham films but also of director Rohit Shetty&rsquo;s cinema as a whole, Singham Again takes it to level next. Which really isn&rsquo;t a good thing from the point of view of the art and craft of cinema but perhaps works in giving fans of this kind of filmmaking ample bang for their buck.</p>
<p>Shetty&rsquo;s films have often been (rightly) accused of having little or no plot, of sacrificing flights of storytelling for flying cars; of nuance for excessiveness. The Singham franchise is no different. The existence of these films has primarily been to showcase its leading man as an ethically strong, no-nonsense super cop, one who wears his Maharashtrian identity proudly on his sleeve and keeps his emotions for Hindustan close to the heart that beats under his lion-tattooed chest.</p>
