    <p>A scene in director Abhilash Reddy Kankara’s Telugu film Maa Nanna Superhero (my dad is a superhero) shows the protagonist Johnny (Sudheer Babu) taking his house owner to task and abruptly pausing when the latter’s daughter comes into the picture. He does not want to make the man seem a lesser mortal to his child. The narrative attempts to ride on the universal emotion of children seeing their father as a superhero. Abhilash wonders how far a son would go to save his father, with whom he shares a tumultuous relationship. The plot becomes more complex as it involves a father Srinivas (Sayaji Shinde) and his adopted son Johnny, and later, the biological father also returns. This idea might seem intriguing at the script level, but the film seems uneven and is held together by a few endearing moments.</p>
<p>In the opening segment, Prasad (Saichand), a lorry driver in need of money reluctantly leaves his infant son in an orphanage for a few days, promising to return soon after completing a job. The setting is the early 80s, before the arrival of mobile phones and when not everyone had a landline. The manager (Jhansi) of the orphanage does not ask too many questions. It is remarkable how Jhansi portrays both tenacity and empathy through her body language in the brief role where she gets to speak very little. She also handles the film’s production design that is in sync with the setting of the story. A turn of events lands Prasad in prison. The narrative does not dwell on the details of how he is made the scapegoat for ferrying drugs. There is not even a passing mention of the actual peddlers. The story prefers to focus on the emotional plight of the father who has no way to contact the orphanage.</p>
