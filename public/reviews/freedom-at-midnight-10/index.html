    <p>One of the most painful and fraught chapters of India&rsquo;s history is brought to life in the SonyLIV series Freedom at Midnight, created by Nikkhil Advani. With a large ensemble cast of Indian and foreign actors, the series moves forwards and backwards in time to depict what went through the minds of India&rsquo;s political leaders as they bargained and argued with the British empire for their freedom. Through the seven episodes, the threat of partition looms large, and the tense finale brings with it a melancholic feeling that lingers.</p>
<p>The series focuses on the Congress leaders Jawaharlal Nehru (Sidhant Gupta), Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (Rajendra Chawla), Mahatma Gandhi (Chirag Vohra), and the All-India Muslim League&rsquo;s Mohammad Jinnah (Arif Zakaria) as they fight for independence from the British. At times, the narrative jumping from past to partition year 1947 is a bit confusing, especially as certain individuals are introduced and later move into the background. The focus of the narrative remains on the insistence of a few like Gandhi, who decried the partition; those like Nehru and Patel, who grudgingly accepted the decision; and Jinnah, whose insistence on a separate Pakistan remained resolute.</p>
