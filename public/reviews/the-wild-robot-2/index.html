    <p>DreamWorks Animation turns 30 this year, and its latest presentation, The Wild Robot, is a great example of what the studio gets right. Adapted and directed by Chris Sanders, the animated feature follows the adventures of Rozzum 7134 (voice of Lupita Nyong&rsquo;o), who discovers a whole new side to herself after she reluctantly adopts a gosling. The family film is filled with humour and meaning, and it teaches you what it means to be kind and love another in need.</p>
<p>After Roz is shipwrecked on an island filled with wild animals, the helpful robot, who desperately needs a task to survive, finds one. She must help raise an orphaned gosling, Brightbill (voice of Kit Connor), with the help of a wily fox, Fink (voice of Pedro Pascal). As she gets Brightbill ready for migration in the winter, Roz discovers her purpose for the island&rsquo;s animals and for herself too.</p>
<p><em>How to Train Your Dragon</em> director Chris Sanders does it again with this touching tale of kindness and love. In the How to Train Your Dragon series, humans and dragons overcome prejudices and learn to rely on one another. In The Wild Robot, the filmmaker and his team touch upon several themes of parenthood, community, and even climate change as it unfolds its emotional narrative from Peter Brown&rsquo;s book. The heart of this beautifully crafted story is the bonds that we form with individuals who become like family. The plotlines should resonate universally across adults and kids alike.</p>
