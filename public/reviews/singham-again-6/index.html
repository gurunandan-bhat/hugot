    <p>They say that the fount of all Indian fiction are the two epics, Ramayan and Mahabharat. Rohit Shetty seems to have taken this old saying to heart because Ajay Devgn’s eponymous Bajirao Singham is none other than a latter-day Maryada Purushottam Ram, his wife Avni (Kareena Kapoor Khan) is the faithful Sita, and all the other characters play their parallels in this version of Kalyug-ke-Ram Ki Katha. The result is loud and tedious, and instantly forgettable.</p>
<p>It’s not as if the earlier cop flicks have been music to the ears. Rohit Shetty’s films embrace cacophony heartily, whether they are comedies, actioners, or a mix of both. But the one cardinal thing that this film seems to have forgotten is that your villains have to be, well, villainous. And if there’s one thing that Arjun Kapoor’s chief baddie doesn’t have is a single menacing bone in his body. Hacking heads off is so not his thing: why this piece of hopeless miscasting?</p>
