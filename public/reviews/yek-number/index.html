    <p>A couple of weeks ago, we saw the release of Dharmaveer 2, in which a deceased political hero, Anand Dighe, was used to glorify and popularize Maharashtraâ€™s current Chief Minister Eknath Shinde. Now, the same kind of propaganda has become the core of another Marathi movie. Titled Yek Number, the film aims to glorify Raj Thackeray, the chief of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS).</p>
<p>As one finally leaves the cinema hall after this 160-minute saga, one just wonders whether, after Hindi cinema, Marathi too will regularly churn out political propaganda films.</p>
<p>Yek Number starts off in a small village in Maharashtra and it revolves around the life of a youngster Pratap (Dhairya Gholap). He believes he is the man Friday of the local MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) but he is actually his slave. He dreams of becoming an MLA and his yes men continuously massage his ego.</p>
