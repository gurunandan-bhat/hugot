    <p>Most directors make you feel like you’re watching their film — their technical prowess, their intent, their voice, their commercial and arthouse ambitions. But directors like Vasan Bala make you feel like you’re watching their dreams come true. His movies aren’t shown, they’re shared. His craft isn’t flaunted, it’s realised. In Jigra, there are no shots, only fulfilled aspirations. There are no scenes and set pieces, only childhood memories. There is no action, only the physicality of emotion. There is no story, only the narrativisation of storytelling.</p>
<p>In an age of lazy remakes and mindless tributes, Bala reimagines a small subplot (featuring Soni Razdan) from Mahesh Bhatt’s Gumrah (1993) as Jigra, a sister-brother story that single-handedly reverses the gender dynamics of Bollywood action thrillers. The way he does this is almost affectionate — it’s the cinematic manifestation of recalling a random detail of an old movie and bringing it to life. Alia Bhatt stars as Satya Anand, a steely-eyed orphan whose younger brother, Ankur (Vedang Raina), is sentenced to death for drug possession in a fictional Southeast Asian country called Manshi Dao. Ankur has been forced to take the fall for the wealthy relatives that brought them up. Satya has no patience for the bureaucracy and rules of a land that’s built on the erasure of empathy. She soon teams up with Bhatia (Manoj Pahwa), the retired gangster father of an inmate on death row, and Muthu (Rahul Ravindran), a retired policeman driven by the guilt of a wrongful arrest; their plans range from jailbreaks to last-ditch infiltrations. Simultaneously, Ankur teams up with a few other inmates to stage their own tunnel escape.</p>
