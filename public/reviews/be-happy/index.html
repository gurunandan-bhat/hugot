    <p>Abhishek Bachchan is shaping into quite a father figure. From playing one to his real-life &lsquo;Paa&rsquo; Amitabh Bachchan wherein the latter&rsquo;s progeria condition ages him dramatically to the point of infirmity, an estranged dad of a precocious kid he reunites with under curious circumstances in Ludo, a divorced daddy surviving medical issues of the life-threatening kind while navigating a bumpy relationship with his daughter in I Want to Talk to a single dad of a smart-alecky princess harbouring dancer dreams in Be Happy, Abhishek has embarked on quite a few journeys where his parenting skills are put to test. Unlike the textbook Papas trickling with emotional wisdom and snuggly warmth, Abhishek&rsquo;s silently supportive approach, playful sarcasm and sparingly expressed authority conveys a father figuring it out as he goes along.</p>
