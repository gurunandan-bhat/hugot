    <p>The story of Mumbai, India’s largest city, is linked inextricably with the story of the Kolis, the lower-caste, Indigenous fisherfolk community whose koliwadas (villages) dot the coastline. Until the 1800s, what we know as Mumbai today used to be an archipelago of seven islands, harmoniously inhabited by Koli communities. These islands turned into a city due to human intervention — a product of several land reclamation projects that also enabled the displacement of Mumbai’s original inhabitants.</p>
<p>It’s poetic then, that Sarvnik Kaur’s masterful Against the Tide opens with images and songs that speak of the resilience and fearlessness embedded deep within Kolis. The only Indian documentary to premiere at the 2023 edition of the Sundance Film Festival, Against the Tide’s conservationist spirit is both intimate and urgent. Kaur doesn’t belabor the point, eschewing rousing statements in favor of piercing observations. Instead, she conjures up an exacting portrait of community and industry, casting an emphatic eye on the professional and personal hurdles that loom over Rakesh and Ganesh, two Koli fishermen friends whose paths have long diverged.</p>
