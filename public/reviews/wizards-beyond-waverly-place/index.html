    <p>If you&rsquo;ve wondered what happened to the Russos of Waverly Place, Disney&rsquo;s latest series Wizards Beyond Waverly Place gives you an update on the family. The new sequel and spinoff rolled into one is more focused on Justin Russo (David Henrie), who returns to his old life in magic, thanks to a new student, a young wizard named Billie (Janice LeAnn Brown). Aimed at a young new generation, Wizards Beyond Waverly Place is a nostalgic watch that fans of the old series can now introduce to their own children.</p>
<p>Henrie&rsquo;s Justin is now a vice principal at a middle school in Staten Island, New York. His wife Giada (Mimi Gianopulos) and two sons Roman (Alkaio Thiele) and Milo (Max Matenko) have no idea he&rsquo;s a wizard. That all changes when his sister Alex (guest star Selena Gomez) comes back into his life to ask him to train a promising young wizard named Billie, after she&rsquo;s kicked out of wizarding school. Justin eventually relents and finds himself back into the world of magic, picking off where he last left off.</p>
