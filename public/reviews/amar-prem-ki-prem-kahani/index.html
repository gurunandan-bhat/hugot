    <p>Amar, who’s yet to come out as gay to his family, is off to London to meet his uncle. Over a flight, he falls in love with a flamboyant Prem. Despite initial friction, the two are inseparable and hit it off as a couple. As Amar returns to India, his conservative family is desperate to get him married. Prem decides to surprise him at the event and when they make their relationship official, all hell breaks loose.</p>
<p>Both the lead actors – Aditya Seal and Sunny Singh – share a warm camaraderie as Prem and Amar. While the director tries to play cautious with their on-screen intimacy, the performers keep the viewers glued with their chemistry and contrasting acting styles. If Aditya oozes confidence in his portrayal of Prem, Sunny is no less convincing as a boy trying to break free from the conservatism in his family. Pranutan Bahl and Diksha J Singh get to make a mark in this male-heavy universe while Jhumma Mitra, Isha Sood don’t disappoint either. Antarjeet Joshi, Sammy Jonas Heaney and others fit the bill in their brief roles.</p>
