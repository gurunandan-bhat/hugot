    <p>Vasan Bala creates worlds that may appear deceptively similar to the ones you and I inhabit but run entirely on their own terms and whimsy. It&rsquo;s a part of the film-maker&rsquo;s charm and cinephile influences, which made the likes of Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota and Monica O My Darling such a treat. Jigra, probably his most big-ticket project so far, is also his most sombre.</p>
<p>More than nods to pop culture moments, he internalises one of its biggest icons, Amitabh Bachchan, as both emotion and grammar. Bachchan, on whose 82nd birthday the movie releases, is Jigra&rsquo;s language, inspiration, attitude and plan B. But Bala is going more for the man&rsquo;s simmer than swagger and the representative of those angry young ideals is not some towering masculine figure but a pocket-sized Alia Bhatt determined to bring her incarcerated brother back home.</p>
<p>Co-produced by her and big sister Shaheen along with Dharma Productions, Jigra&rsquo;s prison break bravado can be best described as Bachchan, Alia Bachchan spearheading Vasan Bala&rsquo;s Bangkok Hilton sans the bullshit but tons of bedlam.</p>
<p>Back in 1993, Dharma made Gumrah directed by Alia&rsquo;s dad Mahesh Bhatt, which rehashed the afore-mentioned Nicole Kidman mini-series to chronicle Sridevi&rsquo;s misery behind bars after she&rsquo;s falsely implicated on drug trafficking charges by the unsympathetic Hong Kong police until rescued in true blue Bollywood fashion by Sanjay Dutt.</p>
