    <p>Comebacks are always interesting, especially when an actor is willing to look back and understand what went wrong in the first place. After a series of misfires, a resurgent Kiran Abbavaram is back with a festive release, mysteriously titled KA, that invests in a solid story over the heroics of the male protagonist. The period thriller offers a rich blend of action and emotions with a karmic twist.</p>
<p>Set in Krishnagiri, a fictional hilly village enveloped by darkness as early as 3 pm, the film unfolds through a series of flashbacks across multiple decades. Abhinaya Vasudev (Kiran Abbavaram) is the orphaned, happy-go-lucky postman who treats the village populace as his extended family. When several women in the village go missing and Vasuâ€™s loved one is nearly abducted, he is determined to find answers.</p>
