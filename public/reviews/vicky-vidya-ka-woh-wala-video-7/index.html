    <p>The year is 1997. The setting is Rishikesh. It’s a time just before mobile phones, when DVDs were still predominant. Writer-director Raaj Shaandilyaa’s film opens with a shoddily executed computer graphic of a train hurtling towards a forlorn man on the tracks. This is the eponymous Vicky, played by Rajkummar Rao. It’s much like Rao’s year which has been speeding along strongly, but will eventually have to come to a halt. Unfortunately, the Rao train has been derailed by this most unintelligible 152-minute-long romantic comedy that is built around a slim plot line.</p>
<p>Newly married couple Vicky, an ambidextrous henna artist, and doctor Vidya (Triptii Dimri) record their honeymoon night as a keepsake. But when the private sex video goes missing, it becomes Vicky’s mission to retrieve the missing disc before his missus finds out and before the contents destroy their reputation.</p>
