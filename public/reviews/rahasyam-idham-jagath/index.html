    <p>How far would you go to help your loved ones? This question is oft explored in books and cinema. If done well, it can be an emotionally moving drama. Komal R Bharadwaj, who has written and directed the Telugu indie film Rahasyam Idham Jagath, gives this idea a different spin, interspersing elements of science fiction and mythology. There is romance, a bitter past, a possibility of revenge, unexplained murky happenings in an eerie setting and the possibility of time travel through a wormhole. It is an ambitious, interesting idea on paper but does not translate to an engrossing adventurous ride, despite the earnest execution of the film.</p>
<p>Rahasyam Idham Jagath unfolds entirely in the United States, in the vicinity of forests of Portland, Oregon. The story follows the journey of a young couple, Abhi (Rakesh Galebhe) and Akira (Sravanthi Prattipati), who decide to return to India following a personal loss, valuing family ties over their American dreams. Before they head home, they plan a brief vacation and are joined by their friends; but nothing goes as planned.</p>
