    <p>In the festive season, director Anees Bazmee tells cinegoers to bring in the popcorn and he would deliver the comic twists. This Deepavali, the director lights up a green cracker that leaves a purple patch in the air but in a bid to be progressive, he fails to keep his traditional comedic pot on the boil and underutilises powerhouse performers like Madhuri Dixit and Vidya Balan to light up the screen.</p>
<p>The third installment of the popular franchise that sparked interest in big-budget horror comedy in Bollywood seems to have been put together in a rush to cash in on the success of the second part. The second installment released just after the pandemic when the entertainment terrain was parched. But the third has come out just after the taut Stree 2 where jokes donâ€™t dry up till the end credits.</p>
