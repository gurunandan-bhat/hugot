    <p>Directed and co-written by Boman Irani, the film also stars him as one of the leading characters alongside Avinash Tiwary, who plays the role of his son Amay. The Mehta Boys follows the father-son duo exploring the complicated relationship and the underlying care and love in it. The film&rsquo;s music and direction keeps the experience raw and relatable, however the writing in the second half begins to falter a bit. Nonetheless, the message comes across well, and it is the performances that keeps you going. The film begins with Amay&rsquo;s journey as an architect who isn&rsquo;t able to assert himself at his workplace, everyone is seen trying to support his vision and his work. But he often ends up giving into the high authority of his seniors even if he doesn&rsquo;t agree with him. But things begin to change for him when a meeting in his office is interrupted to inform him that he received a call about his mother&rsquo;s passing. Without a second thought, Amay leaves for his home.</p>
