    <p>The trailer of Jigra promised a coup too delicious to resist: Alia Bhatt as the Angry Young (Wo)man. At one point, Manoj Pahwa tells her, “Arre, [Amitabh] Bachchan nahin banna hai. Bach ke nikalna hai.” A stone-faced Bhatt replies: “Ab toh Bachchan hi banna hai.” This exchange hides loaded meanings: reverence (Bhatt, the best Bollywood actor right now, paying tribute to the best Bollywood actor of the ’70s), inversion (a heroine playing an anti-hero), and nostalgia (a drug always in short supply). There’s a bit of serendipity, too: the movie’s release date, October 11, coincides with Bachchan’s birthday.</p>
<p>The similarities between Zanjeer (1973) and Jigra—and a sincere yearning for old Bollywood—start from the start. Like Vijay in Zanjeer, Satya (Bhatt) sees her father die. As a kid, she tells her brother, Ankur, that she’ll protect him from his bullies: “Amrish, Jeevan, Ranjeet”—the names of the iconic Bollywood baddies. While spinning a top with her friends, she channels Mithun da: “Koi shaq?”</p>
<p>Satya and Ankur (Vedang Raina) grow up in their uncle’s house—a protection that functions as a transaction. Satya is, in essence, the head of the household staff and when their cousin, Kabir (Aditya Nanda), gets caught with drugs in a fictional South Asian country, Hanshi Dao, the family lawyer brainwashes Ankur to take the blame. He does and finds out the punishment: death by electrocution. Burning with rage, Satya lands in the country: to save her brother, to kick some ass, to make revenge look like casual breakfast.</p>
