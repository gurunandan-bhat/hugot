    <p>Much of our history was unknown in 1975 when Freedom At Midnight by Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins, the bestseller documenting the backstage events that led to the bloody Partition of India, was first published. In recent years, there has been such a glut of printed and visual information on what happened in 1947 that Indians are familiar with most of the Nehru-Gandhi-Patel-Jinnah parleys which director Nikkhil Advani sets out to preserve on film.</p>
<p>With six writers on board (Abhinandan Gupta, Gundeep Kaur, Adwitiya Kareng Das, Divy Nidhi Sharma, Revanta Sarabhai, Ethan Taylor), equations and situations go back to the early 1900s. Mohammed Ali Jinnah (Arif Zakaria), his pipe, his TB cough and his arrogance intact, crowns himself the voice of the Indian Muslim. With a visceral hatred for Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Chirag Vohra) and his popularity, Jinnahâ€™s insistence on a separate land for Muslims makes the bifurcation of India on religious lines, inevitable.</p>
