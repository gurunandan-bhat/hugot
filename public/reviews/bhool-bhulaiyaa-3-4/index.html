    <p>Some movies are so entertaining that they make you miss the good old days. But others are so vapid that they make you miss good days. Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 is “others”. You see Vidya Balan, and fondly reminisce about Priyadarshan’s Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007) and Pritam’s hit soundtrack. You see Vidya Balan and Madhuri Dixit playing enigmatic women, and think of how well they were cast in Abhishek Chaubey’s Ishqiya (2010) and Dedh Ishqiya (2014). You see a tragic female ghost haunt a mansion and morph into a human social message in a setting full of foolish men, and it’s hard not to respect how fundamentally sound the Stree movies are. You see crows descend from the dark skies for dramatic effect and think of The Crows Have Eyes III: The Crowening, the Bosnian B-movie starring Moira Rose in Schitt’s Creek.</p>
<p>I should stop here but, in good conscience, I cannot. You see two rival sisters, any of whom can be malevolent spirit Manjulika, and you miss Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 (2022) and Tabu’s double role. You see the uncultured assault on all things Bengali and miss the lavish assault of Devdas (2002). You see a ghastly twist that bats for inclusivity the way the current Indian Test team bats for draws, and you miss very specific performances like Jitin Gulati’s in Kaala (2023). You see a remixed dance version of a Kashmiri folk song and miss the purity of the same track from The Family Man (2019), or even the refashioned Iranian song in Animal (2023). You see gags like two cows being named Rolls and Royce, and miss the family-friendly inanity of Welcome (2007) and Dhamaal (2007). In other words, you see Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 and end up seeing everything but Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3.</p>
