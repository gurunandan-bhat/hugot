    <p>A Roman general, in a bid to expand his base, ventures out into the open sea with his army. Before you think you have inadvertently clicked the link to the review of Gladiator 2, fret not; this is how Kanguva begins. The fascinating story of director Siva’s Kanguva stretches from a legendary island’s hills to the sandy shores of Goa; it even transcends time as its proceedings occur in two different timelines. But whether they amalgamate to make for an intriguing watch is a different question altogether.</p>
<p>In Kanguva, Suriya plays Francis, a bounty hunter who comes in contact with a lost kid, with whom he seems to share a connection from their past lives. We then see how around 1000 years ago, in a five-island landmass — each with its own set of chiefdoms, customs and professions (straight from the pages of Raya and the Last Dragon) — Suriya, also playing the titular role, as the son of Perumaachi’s chieftain, makes a promise to the same kid. As history repeats itself, our protagonist has to save this child to know how they are connected.</p>
