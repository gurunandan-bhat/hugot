    <p>It was 2015 when SS Rajamouli&rsquo;s &lsquo;Baahubali&rsquo; was released and blew everyone&rsquo;s mind. To this day, the two &lsquo;Baahubali&rsquo; films not only shattered box office records but also set a benchmark for films of the same ilk. Nealy a decade later, director Nag Ashwin, with monumental ambitions, gifted &lsquo;Kalki 2898 AD&rsquo;, set in a dystopian world. With futuristic ideas coupled with Hindu mythology, the film will surely blow your mind, just like &lsquo;Baahubali&rsquo; did. Thousands of years after the Mahabharata war, Kashi became the last city of the world. And the world is ruled by Supreme Yaskin (Kamal Haasan), who is waiting for a magical serum to gain powers. The poor suffer in the city, while the rich enjoy their lives in the Complex, a place built for the privileged. It is Bhairava&rsquo;s (Prabhas) dream to make it to the Complex. He is a bounty hunter doing petty jobs to earn the units that will enable him to earn his place in the Complex.</p>
