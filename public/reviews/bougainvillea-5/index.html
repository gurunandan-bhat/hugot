    <p>Amal Neerad&rsquo;s Bougainvillea features an impressive cast, including Kunchacko Boban, Jyothirmay, and Fahadh Faasil; however, the film ultimately flatters to deceive. Faasil is relegated to a tertiary role, likely either to help out his friends or for a fat paycheck – probably the former. Pitched as a psychological thriller, the film becomes exasperating due to its screenplay and overall execution.</p>
<p>For a film of this nature, a concise narrative is essential, along with an assumption that the audience possesses a degree of intelligence—an area where Bougainvillea falters. Neerad&rsquo;s method involves showing then explaining, and then repeating the &lsquo;show part again for those who may still not have grasped it. For example, the film repeatedly informs viewers about the kidnapping of three girls. Once the perpetrator is revealed – something that becomes evident well before the actual disclosure – there is little value in depicting all three kidnappings in flashback, as the method remains consistent and ultimately becomes irrelevant.</p>
