    <p>The growing worry about lack of quality control in the OTT space now has a physical embodiment. Do Patti. A film which may have its heart in the right place but is otherwise all over the place. Do Patti aims to be a sensitive and scathing film on domestic abuse. The other tags it wants to earn for itself are a noir thriller, a police procedural, a film on sibling rivalry, a blistering criticism of privilege and a racy romance laced with sex, lies and videotape (or rather, mobile phone footage). It ends up being neither.</p>
<p>Do Patti, directed by Shashanka Chaturvedi, is a disjointed watch which tests your patience at almost every turn. Its amateurish treatment in terms of premise, plot, players and pacing makes a mockery of the pressing social issue it attempts to address.</p>
