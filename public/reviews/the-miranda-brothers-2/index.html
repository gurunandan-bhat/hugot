    <p>Julio, the son of a single parent Susan Miranda, requests his mother to adopt an infant who’s left stranded on the streets. Braving past several financial challenges, Susain raises Julio and Regalo, who are extremely fond of one another. As adults, they hope to make a career in football. However, when a personal setback tests their equation, Regalo has a tough choice to make.</p>
<p>Harshavardhan Rane’s toned body is the only good excuse to distract you from the superficiality of his performance. However, the role doesn’t offer him anything substantial either. Much like him, Meezan Jaffri fares no better, creating little impact as an actor despite his good looks. Both female leads – Jeniffer Piccinato and Sahher Bamba – are offered inconsequential roles.</p>
