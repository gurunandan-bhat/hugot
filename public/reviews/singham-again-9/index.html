    <p>Can we let the epics be? Rohit Shetty&rsquo;s latest film Singham Again - a part of his elaborate cop universe essembles some of the biggest stars of Bollywood to narrate an unoriginal story and borrows the full plot from Hindu epic mythology Ramayan. But at a time when films like Adipurush and the anime Ramayan are already available in the digital space, how good an idea is it to again refurbish a known story and force-feed it through Shetty&rsquo;s larger-than-life, over-the-top cop universe? Questions such as this and a few more remain unanswered throughout the runtime of the film.</p>
<p>The plot thanks to the makers and a very elaborate trailer (longest for a Hindi film, they claim) is already known. And so when you walk into the theatres, aware of the story, you expect the film to entertain you with its dialogue baazi, its action sequences and more. Yet Shetty&rsquo;s film - the third in the Singham franchise - is formulaic and plays to gallery with predictable moves and lines.</p>
