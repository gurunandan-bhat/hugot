    <p>After a shortened season earlier this year due to the Hollywood strikes, Abbott Elementary is back on schedule with a full season. This time, the teachers&rsquo; gang at the Philadelphia school convene for a new school year with plenty of hijinks. The biggest change this season is that the perennial will-they, won&rsquo;t-they couple Janine (Quinta Brunson) and Gregory (Tyler James Williams) have made it official. But what does this mean for the rest of the season? Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>
<p>Aside from the Janine-Gregory romance, there&rsquo;s a new development outside the school. A new golf course is being built near the school, disrupting their daily routines. The construction work cuts off the water and gas at Willard R Abbott Elementary School. But the biggest change is that the school gets its first white student. Principal Ava Coleman&rsquo;s (Janelle James) reaction to this is hilarious. While this golf course obstacle might last for a few episodes, fans are really interested to see how Janine and Gregory deal with being boyfriend and girlfriend this season.</p>
