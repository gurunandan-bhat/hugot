    <p>The Wild Robot was one of the most anticipated films since its first teaser dropped with the song &lsquo;What a Wonderful World&rsquo; and the film has lived up to its hype. Not only does it offer an adorable story for kids to watch but it also comes with heavy context and geological subtext that is enough to keep the adults engaged. The film unexpectedly also offers much humour and some emotional moments but best yet has been the artwork throughout the run time. From birds taking flight and colouring the sky, to the moving leaves that breathe life into the art, the film comes with a great re-watch value ready to turn it into a classic.</p>
<p>The film begins with a flashing thunderstorm which leads our Universal Dynamics all purpose ROZZUM robot into the wilderness. As a cargo ship crashes into the sea, six robots are destroyed except one, Rozzum 7134. Accidently woken by a group of otters, Rozzum sets out into the wild looking for its purpose. She walks through all the wild advertising her services, looking for the one who called her and needs her but all she manages to do is terrify the animals on the island.</p>
