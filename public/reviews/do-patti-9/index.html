    <p>Twins Saumya and Shailee (Kriti Sanon in a double role, this is not a spoiler) are like chalk and cheese. One gets married to hot-headed Dhruv Sood, (television actor Shaheer Sheikh) the privileged man with a volatile temper and political connect who owns a paragliding business in the hills. All’s well on the surface until an unlikely crime makes police officer VJ (Kajol) question everything about this family.</p>
<p>Do Patti is deceptive. In an ideal scenario, this could have worked wonders as a thriller but that’s not the case here. Do Patti is deceptive as a film, not as a mystery. You are led on and lured into believing that there’s more to this long-winding twin sister saga but it’s all a damp squib. For some strange reason, you pin your hopes on the big twist that might redeem the situation but that wish stays unfulfilled as it&rsquo;s predictable and underwhelming.</p>
