    <p>Nick and Charlie are back with a summer to remember. The third season of Heartstopper, based on the best-selling graphic novel by Alice Oseman, continues with the love story between Kit Connor&rsquo;s Nick and Joe Locke&rsquo;s Charlie as their relationship grows stronger despite their fears and insecurities. There is a whole new vibe to the series (the teens are now allowed to curse and become sexually active) that shows how the material has evolved along with its characters. At its heart, Heartstopper is a sweet romance with depth, especially due to the sparkling chemistry of its leads.</p>
<p>Before Nick (Kit Connor) goes away on vacation, his boyfriend Charlie (Joe Locke) struggles to tell him those all-important three words. But more than their relationship growing, the couple must open up to each other about some serious topics and learn the importance of asking for help. Their friends Tao (William Gao), Elle (Yasmin Finney), Tara (Corrina Brown), Darcy (Kizzy Edgell), and Isaac (Tobie Donovan) are more like family, and they all help each other through issues of identity, growing up, and teenage angst.</p>
