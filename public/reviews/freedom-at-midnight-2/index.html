    <p>As children, most of us learn to see 1947 as India’s finest moment. The event is simple: India gained freedom from the greedy British Raj and that’s that. As teenagers, we start to sense that perhaps it wasn’t all smooth and happy. With independence came the pressure to move out and grow up. But it doesn’t matter much because, either way, colonialism ended. As we get older, however, a full and bittersweet picture emerges: a nation is free, only to be violently divided into two on the basis of religion. It was never as simple as the British leaving or a newly born country celebrating its revolutionaries. This fuller picture has been molded — and revised — into shapeless stories by a future reeling from its scars. History is what happened, but these days, history is what we choose to believe.</p>
<p>In that sense, Nikkhil Advani’s Freedom at Midnight is an unusual entry in the Partition canon. Based on the 1975 book of the same name, the 7-episode series unfolds as a bureaucratic backroom drama situated in an anticlimactic and complicated year between the short-lived joy of independence and long-term despair of partition. It is rooted in a post-gut clarity of grappling with one question: now what? The freedom fighters are past their heroic primes; they’re now messy architects, angry and anxious and disorientingly human, often burdened by the chilling connotations of identity. They’ve reached the summit — a triumph that every Indian child will learn of. The series captures the moment they discover the real challenge is going back down — a journey that every Indian adult will strive to unlearn.</p>
