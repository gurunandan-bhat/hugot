    <p>One day, a foul-mouthed man on the cusp of 70 realises that he doesn’t have any achievement in his lifelog that will keep him alive for posterity. A national-level swimmer who didn’t strive enough to change the colour of his bronze medal, Vijay Mathew (Anupam Kher) is an ordinary old man seeking a sliver of gold dust. Having lost his supportive wife to cancer, he is withering from the inside and appears grumpy from the outside. Still, he hasn’t given up on the magic of life and doesn’t want those around him to undermine his leap of faith when an opportunity presents itself. Vijay decides to participate in a tough triathlon contest to make it to record books and give something back to his friends who stood by him.</p>
<p>Writer-director Akshay Roy has a promising premise about a complex character that we can relate to but the film fails to provide him the wheels to last the distance. On paper, it reads like an episode in Anupam’s popular play Kuchh Bhi Ho Sakta Hai that celebrates the extraordinary leaps that ordinary life can take. However, it works out like a PowerPoint presentation to sell Vijay to a disbelieving audience, in which slides touch upon the obvious obstacles in the path of the unlikely hero, without being kneaded into a compelling storyline or generating an engaging experience. Instead of instilling emotion into the narrative, Roy keeps falling back on the Asha Bhosle number “Aage Bhi Jaane Na Tu&hellip;” from Waqt (1965) to underline the essence of the film.</p>
