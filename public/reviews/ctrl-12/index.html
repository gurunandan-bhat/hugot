    <p>There’s one significant challenge to making ‘screen-life films’ (films that unfold almost entirely on digital screens). Once you commit to its visual grammar, you’re tied to them till there’s a good reason to break out of it. No matter what, all your exposition needs to happen on the small screen, key plot points need to be hashed out during video calls, and the filmmakers need to keep imagining newer screens – ranging from iPad, mobile phones, CCTVs, GoPros, webcams, paparazzi lenses, TV screens etc.</p>
<p>It’s an obstacle that definitively trips Vikramaditya Motwane’s CTRL – when a character discusses a top-secret project and another character’s involvement with it, especially after their disappearance for example. I might be projecting my expectations on the film here, but I find it hard to believe that a smart lawyer’s first hunch would be to discuss all this in a video chat, without the slightest hint that these devices might be under surveillance? I wondered if Motwane and writer Avinash Sampath were trapped in their own maze.</p>
