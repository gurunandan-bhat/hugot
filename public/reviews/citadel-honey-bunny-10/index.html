    <p>Citadel: Honey Bunny is the third series in the Citadel universe. Arriving on the heels of the Italian series Citadel: Diana, the Indian version is a prequel story that links into the main Amazon Prime Video series. Developed by Sita Menon and directed by Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK (Raj &amp; DK), Citadel: Honey Bunny has a sluggish start introducing the characters and the Indian connection. However, over six episodes, the series builds on the characters&rsquo; connections for a solid finish.</p>
<p>Single mother Honey (Samantha) has raised her daughter Nadia (Kashvi Majmundar) to expect the unexpected. A former spy, Honey, is once again thrust into the limelight when some old foes discover her again. One of the people from her past life includes Bunny (Varun Dhawan), who initiated her into the world. But there are larger factors at play, with rival spy agencies vying for a device that will give them ultimate power. The newly reunited family has to figure out a way to survive.</p>
