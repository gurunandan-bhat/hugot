    <p>While most filmmakers focus on the bigger aspects of their story to substantiate the so-called big-screen experience, C Prem Kumar belongs to a niche group of directors who like to concentrate on the finer, intimate moments of life. Probably because of his time spent behind the viewfinder as a cinematographer, Prem’s scenes look like animated still photographs, and just like his directorial debut 96, his sophomore outing Meiyazhagan is a series of moments in motion.</p>
<p>In Meiyazhagan, Prem poses several questions that you believe to have answered ages ago; for example, apart from the obvious answer, have you ever wondered why your birthplace is called your hometown? Meiyazhagan starts in 1996 (clearly not co-incidental) when a young Arunmozhi Varman a.k.a Arul is subjected to a pain seldom captured on celluloid. Cut to 2018, his cousin’s marriage forces him back to his homeland and hoping to find closure, Arul (Arvind Swami) embarks on what he expects to be a swift and hasty trip. Fate adds a tail to the full stop he long wished for and introduces him to a relative (Karthi), whose name Arul can just not recall.</p>
