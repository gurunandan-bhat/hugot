    <p>Is domestic abuse a hush-hush family matter or a crime against society? Is a judge who goes by the word of law (and evidence) dispensing true justice or is a lawyer who looks at the spirit of the law more inclined towards social good?</p>
<p>At the end of a disturbing narration where nothing seems to be what it is, writer Kanika Dhillon (story, screenplay, dialogues) opens up an important but inconvenient debate that brings abuse out of the four walls of the house.</p>
<p>Identical twins Saumya and Shailee (Kriti Sanon) and their nanny-turned-mom (Tanvi Azmi) who’s caught between the dissimilar personalities of the two siblings, keep cop woman Vidya Jyothi Kanwar (Kajol) on her toes. The hill station of Devipur is turned upside down with the arrival of entitled businessman Dhruv Sood (Shaheer Sheikh), owner of an adventure sports company. “Paragliding is not an adventure sport, it’s a dating sport,” quips Dhruv as he floors both sisters.</p>
<p>There are some obviously laboured lines. The nanny-turned-Amma serves a drink to Dhruv from out of the blue with two different glasses on the tray. It facilitates the line, “Are you sure you’re not making a mistake with your choice, Dhruv?” He chooses. Also abuses.</p>
