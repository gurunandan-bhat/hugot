    <p>Citadel: Honey Bunny is a catchy title. In fact, you can almost hear it. “Honey Bunny” instantly evokes the viral Idea Cellular ad jingle from 2012: you’re my pumpkin pumpkin/hello honey bunny. But there’s more to the earworm than a Pulp Fiction tribute or a term of endearment. The commercial itself showed a traveler infecting different parts of the country with a tune; the cutesy lyrics, too, felt like the collective sound of couples staying connected across regions. It’s not a stretch to suggest that Citadel: Honey Bunny — whose pan-world premise features a pan-Indian adventure of a couple named Honey (Samantha Ruth Prabhu) and Bunny (Varun Dhawan) — is a long-form descendent of the jingle. It’s totally on brand for director duo Raj &amp; DK, who thrive on affectionate pop-cultural nods, cinephilia and retro references.</p>
<p>Much like Guns &amp; Gulaabs (2023), their six-episode thriller unfolds in the 1990s, offering them plenty of scope to texturise a globe-trotting narrative. It’s full of narrative colour and detail across two separate timelines (1992 and 2000). Bunny is a Bollywood stuntman who moonlights as a spy; Honey is a struggling actress who joins his team. Honey’s daughter in 2000, Nadia (Kashvi Majmundar), is named after Australian-Indian stuntwoman and star Fearless Nadia; the poster of her cult film, Diamond Queen (1940), appears more than once. Honey’s younger version looks like early Shilpa Shetty, complete with hair ribbons, denims and a nasal voice. A VHS tape of Gair Kanooni (1989) becomes a bonding device; playful scenes (including a first kiss and a first family moment) revolve around Honey and Bunny’s split-second glimpses as backup dancer and stunt-biker in the film. A blood-drenched Cassata ice-cream slab shapes Bunny’s childhood trauma. A top-secret exchange happens between chat handles called Albert Pinto and Break Dancer. Bunny and his colleagues use cinema-coded nicknames like Predator and Terminator.</p>
