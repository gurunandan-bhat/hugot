    <p>Former United States president and presidential candidate Donald Trump went on a rant recently on filmmaker Ali Abbasi&rsquo;s latest film The Apprentice, which narrates the Republican&rsquo;s initial years as a real estate giant in New York and his relationship with attorney Roy Cohn. Perhaps, Trump&rsquo;s reaction stems from information that is fed to him because had he watched the film, he may have only objected to certain aspects of Abbasi&rsquo;s provocative film and not ranted about it in its entirety.</p>
<p>The Apprentice shows Trump (played stupendously well by Sebastian Stan) in his usual megalomaniac, ruthless avatar – an image that Trump has over the years created – painstakingly, if I may add so – but also humanises him to a certain extent. Written by Gabriel Sherman, the film mostly focuses on Trump in his initial years, trying desperately to break into the elite circle of New York and become famous and grow his father&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>It is at a members-only elite club that young Trump meets the bullish Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong), a star attorney who takes a liking for the blonde young man. It takes Donald a bit of persuasion to convince him to represent his father in a case that the federal government has slapped against Trump Village which has discriminated against African-American tenants. Roy eventually agrees as he feels Trump is a &lsquo;24-carat American patriot&rsquo;. Not only does Cohn win the case, but he takes Trump under his wings and moulds him as a ruthless businessman who can go to any length, and use all sorts of nefarious tactics to bend state laws to build his real estate empire.</p>
