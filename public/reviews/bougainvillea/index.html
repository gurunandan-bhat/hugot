    <p>Director Amal Neerad&rsquo;s latest movie Bougainvillea is a slow-burning thriller that offers more strengths than weaknesses in its entertainment value. Set against the backdrop of an unreliable memory, the film borrows elements from classics like Memento and The Usual Suspects, while crafting a uniquely Malayalam narrative.</p>
<p>What sets Bougainvillea apart is Neerad’s ability to command attention, even with minimal marketing. Filling half a theatre on a Thursday morning in Bengaluru for a Malayalam film speaks volumes about the anticipation surrounding Neerad’s projects, a testament to his loyal fanbase and established reputation. The film itself lives up to expectations, offering fans signature Amal Neerad moments: slow-motion sequences, intense visuals, and an atmospheric score by Sushin Shyam that keeps the tension simmering throughout.</p>
<p>In Bougainvillea, we have an unreliable narrator, Reethu Thomas (Jyothirmayi), an amnesiac struggling to get through her day-to-day life. Fortunately for her, she has a caring and generous husband, Dr. Royce Thomas (Kunchacko Boban). Reethu becomes a key witness and suspect in a missing person case involving the daughter of a high-profile Tamil Nadu politician. This leads ACP David Koshy IPS (Fahadh Faasil) to investigate, poking holes in Reethu’s memory bubble and unleashing a can of worms. With all the main players in place, Amal Neerad tells the story of the protagonist’s trauma through her faulty memory in a visually engrossing way. The tension is heightened by the nuanced performances of Jyothirmayi and Kunchacko Boban as the search for the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; intensifies.</p>
