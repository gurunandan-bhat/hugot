    <p>L2: Empuraan is the sequel to 2019’s Lucifer and the second instalment in a planned trilogy. The movie, which is now in theatres, continues the tale of the dreaded criminal Khureshi Ab’ram (or Stephen Nedumpally), who we learned in the first movie is not the axis of evil as many had thought. In fact, he and his gang fight injustice all over the world. The movie’s ending and that post-credit scene leave more questions than answers. Here is all you need to know about L2: Empuraan, its plot, ending, cast, release date, trailer, and a review. The film brings superstar Mohanlal back in the titular role. The film is once again about the intersection of politics, religion, and crime. The plot is set about five years after the original. Five years is also the length of a Chief Minister’s full term in India.</p>
