    <p>For Tarantino, it’s the foot shot. For Rohit Shetty, it’s the drone shot. And for Neeraj Pandey, it’s the walking-talking shot: unbroken over-the-shoulder and full-frontal shots of self-serious men striding in and out of spaces, between rooms and corridors, between people and objects. Cops walk. Robbers walk. Waiters walk. Dogs walk. Thoughts walk. The air walks. No cinematographer finishes a schedule unfit. Basically, walking equals narrative momentum. Pandey is a master at making it look like something is always happening even when nothing is — but not in a good way.</p>
<p>In Sikandar Ka Muqaddar, the background score is an extension of everyone’s busy legs. It’s like a gym membership for film-making. No moment is allowed to exist without a sense of urgency and emotional cardio. A man moving in with his girlfriend cannot be just that. The glum man leaves his house — tense music suggests that his next step is a mystery. He knocks on a strange door — the music reaches a crescendo. The girlfriend opens the door and they both smile — soft anti-climactic piano takes over. The shortest of scenes are forced to have three acts. A character so much as breathes, and the aggressive score asks: is he really breathing? I paused the movie to fix myself some dinner, and the music in my head asked: wait, is the rice burnt? I take a restroom break, and the music asks: is his kidney failing? You get the gist.</p>
