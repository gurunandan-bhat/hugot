    <p>One of my pet peeves features Hindi cinema’s toxic relationship with technology. You know how, in the middle of a public event, every single cellphone in the hall simultaneously beeps with a headline alert because the famous person it’s about is also present? Everyone turns to dramatically look at this unfortunate person; whispers and gossipy glances hijack the scene. This is how news spreads in such stories. It can be at a press conference, a panel discussion, even at a party. In Mithya: The Darker Chapter, it’s at a business auction that comes to a standstill. My questions are simple. How is it that nobody’s phone is on vibrate mode? Why are the shock and awe so coordinated? Why is it that no other message or app on the phone has a pop-up sound? The closest I’ve experienced as a real-world viewer is when, during a press screening of Super 30 (2019), most journalists in the hall audibly gasped when Dhoni got run out in that World Cup semifinal.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve gotten this out of my system, back to business. Based on the British TV series Cheat (2019), Mithya: The Darker Chapter is the follow-up season to Mithya (2022), a corny thriller revolving around an honest literature teacher (Huma Qureshi, as Juhi Adhikari) and her unhinged student (Avantika Dassani, as Rhea Rajguru) who, ultimately, turn out to be half-sisters. The first season ends with Rhea getting arrested for the murder of a pregnant Juhi’s husband, after their dad Anand (Rajit Kapur) atones for his sins by choosing the nice daughter over the illegitimate one. The setting is Darjeeling, yet another hilltown reduced to an atmospheric template by the streaming-era algorithm. Season 2 unfolds a few years later. Juhi is now an author whose debut book, Dhund (“fog”), is a bestseller; she is a single mother who lives with her parents in a cottage that looks like it’s run by an Airbnb superhost; she is also about to start afresh with her son in faraway Oxford as a Hindi professor. All is well, until Rhea returns from jail (as if she was on a hipster sabbatical) for a new round of revenge and robotic swag, while a small-time writer named Amit (Naveen Kasturia) accuses Juhi of plagiarising his work. Naturally, the two are connected.</p>
