    <p>Co produced by Kriti Sanon and Kanika Dhillon the film suffers from lack of consistency possibly from the writing stage. The film aims to spread awareness about women and domestic abuse, it attempts to express the turmoils of abuse trauma, its generational history but fails to do it through out the run time. The film tries hard to be It Suspect X (Jaane Jaan), It Ends With Us, Gone Girl and The Girl In The Train all at once with a crime thriller genre — it ends up being none of them.</p>
<p>It begins with VJ, a cop is unable to find a case to keep and give justice to. When a call is made about domestic violence and the wife refuses to file a complaint, she gets obsessed with the family. After following them for a while, VJ finds out Saumya has a twin sister and a nani who over the years has turned into her mother. Amma reveals the call was made by her and she goes on to reveal why Saumya would refuse to file for a complaint. As the trailer revealed, the twin sisters don’t have the best relationship. They don’t just hate each other, but they compete with each other even for the love of Dhruv, husband to Saumya and ex-boyfriend to Shailee.</p>
