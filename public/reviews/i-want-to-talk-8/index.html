    <p>Shoojit Sircar’s recent film work has been preoccupied with mortality. Shiuli’s freak accident and subsequent state determine the course of October (2018). Gulabo Sitabo (2020) is a comic look at death, with an ageing man hoping for the demise of his even older wife. And Sardar Udham is death-haunted, not just the historical fact of the protagonist’s execution but the guiding hand of the ghosts of Jallianwala Bagh.</p>
<p>I Want To Talk, directed by Sircar and written by Ritesh Shah, introduces the possibility of death about 10 minutes in, and never lets it fade from view. Arjun (Abhishek Bachchan) is a marketing professional in California, highly successful if rather unfeeling and shallow. During a presentation, he starts coughing violently. The next scene is Arjun in hospital. The scene after that, a doctor tells him he has cancer and probably 100 days to live.</p>
