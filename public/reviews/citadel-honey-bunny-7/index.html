    <p>The choices in Citadel: Honey Bunny sing less frequently compared to other undertakings of the Raj &amp; DK filmmaker duo. An offshoot of Amazon Prime’s gazillion-dollar spy franchise pitted against the silliness of James Bond, Jason Bourne, Ethan Hunt, etc., Raj &amp; DK’s latest carries the baggage of an over-embellished universe tensely fitted into a studio-approved runtime. Like its American counterpart helmed by the Russo brothers, even the Indian version spans six episodes with a duration of 40-50 minutes each.</p>
<p>No one stops to smell the flowers in Citadel; every detail is synthesised in a manner for a payoff. Citadel is the kind of shiny, continuously-pruned-by-audience-testing franchise that seems to be at war with the strong authorial voice of its creator-duo: famous for their ironic, whimsical, do-it-yourself aesthetic. Having suffered through the American series, starring Priyanka Chopra and Richard Madden, I remember thinking even a ‘bad’ Raj &amp; DK show would be an improvement for Citadel.</p>
