    <p>The saying &rsquo;truth is stranger than fiction&rsquo; hits harder in films adapted from true-crime stories. The drama feature, Woman of the Hour, tells the unbelievable story of a serial killer who somehow ended up on a dating show as an eligible bachelor in the late 1970s. The shocking story is told by actress Anna Kendrick in her promising directorial debut that is sure to leave an impact.</p>
<p>The film is set in 1977-1978, following the serial killer Rodney Alcala (Daniel Zovatto), who stalked and murdered women on the pretext of photographing them all over the US. When he lands on a dating show, Rodney ends up being the only bachelor on the panel of three that aspiring actress Sheryl Bradshaw (Kendrick) unfortunately connects with. Woman of the Hour unnervingly shows how few people picked up on Rodney&rsquo;s creepy vibe and suspected something was amiss. And how it took a while before &lsquo;The Dating Game Killer&rsquo; was eventually brought to justice.</p>
