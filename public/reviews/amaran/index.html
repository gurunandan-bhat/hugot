    <p>Amaran is based on the life of Major Mukund Varadarajan, who died during an anti-terror operation in Jammu and Kashmir in 2014. Biopics like this come with a unique challenge: since audiences already know the outcome, there’s little room for surprises. Directors often leverage the emotional depth of such stories to create resonance, sometimes stirring complex emotions or evoking our deepest fears. Filmmaker Rajkumar Periasamy, as expected, focuses on these emotional elements, ultimately leaving the audience with a deeper understanding of the human conflict hidden beneath layers of turmoil.</p>
<p>First things first, Sivakarthikeyan and Sai Pallavi are outstanding in Amaran. They breathe fresh life into the genre, telling a story of sacrifice and bravery at the border. Though the movie centres around Major Mukund Varadarajan, it is Sai Pallavi’s portrayal of Indhu Rebecca Varghese that sweeps us into an emotional whirlwind. Indhu’s character humanizes Mukund, deepening our connection with his story. Her presence makes the film’s conclusion far more moving than the reactions evoked by typical news headlines about army casualties in terror attacks.</p>
