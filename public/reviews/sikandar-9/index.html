    <p>Sikandar, directed by A.R. Murugadoss, known for films like Ghajini, makes an honest effort with the story, but the execution doesn&rsquo;t match up to its potential. The film essentially follows a good-natured man who aims to live up to his dead wife&rsquo;s expectations and keep what is left of her safe. The makers take an emotional, very Bollywood masala approach with its story, but it still could have been enjoyable without the flimsy editing and screenplay. The film begins with Raja Sahab&rsquo;s aka Sanjay aka Sikandar introduction through the film&rsquo;s minor villain. When a politician&rsquo;s son is blackmailing and harassing a girl on a flight, Snjay takes it upon himself to teach the kid a lesson. However, when a complaint is filed against him, the politician and his corrupt officer, Sanjay&rsquo;s beloved praja, saves him from arrest. Rashmika Mandana is his fairly young and devoted wife. Indebted by his selfless act to marry her, he takes it upon herself to always be the one between him and any danger. After some goons are sent behind Sanjay, in an accident, Saisri passes away.</p>
