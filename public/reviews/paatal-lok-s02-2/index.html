    <p>When we first met Hathiram Chaudhary in the summer of 2020, humanity was in the grip of a severe pandemic, and &lsquo;paatal lok&rsquo; — to now put it lightly — didn&rsquo;t seem to be too much of an alien word (or world) at that moment. The show provided a much-needed distraction, and was a rare watch that gave us food for thought, metamorphosing from a police procedural to a tightly-knit thriller that compelled us to examine the fault lines of caste, social prejudice, marginalisation, vote-bank politics, fake news and religious divide. Five years later, Hathiram — played like second skin by the irrepressible Jaideep Ahlawat — is back. In Season 2, the stakes may be higher, the socio-political environment more tense and the cocktail of betrayal, deceit, double-cross and revenge more tricky and tenuous&hellip; but Hathiram has remained the same. A man still world-weary and honest to a fault. But if angst defined Chaudhary in the first season — a sincere if bullheaded cop thirsting for one challenging case in his predominantly unremarkable career — it is acceptance that forms his core this time. Hathiram hasn&rsquo;t made any significant strides in his career, but as a man he seems content. &lsquo;Seems&rsquo; is the operative word here.</p>
