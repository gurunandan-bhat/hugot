    <p>When an Abhishek Bachchan starrer comes along, you’re assured that there will be something different and something endearing on offer. Whether it works or not. With a repertoire that includes Vicky Donor and Piku, director Shoojit Sircar also stands for cinema with a difference. Again, whether it works or not. The qualities associated with Bachchan and Sircar combine to tell the real-life tale of an unknown Arjun Sen, inspirational in its own way. Arjun’s days are numbered, say the docs. His surgeries can no longer be counted on his fingers. He’s lost his roof to wife in a divorce settlement, his job to laryngeal cancer. His legendary arrogance has been whittled down, he’s become a statistic. One of those that sum up your chances of survival as bleak. He almost drives his Cadillac off the cliff, one evening.</p>
<p>After sending ‘thank you’ gifts to the caring few who’ve been around. But Arjun Sen (Abhishek Bachchan), once the blue-eyed wonder boy of the marketing world, markets his persistence, sells the medical world a story of how to manipulate life itself and reverse a dire medical sentence. Set in the US, writer Ritesh Shah generously sprays English all over the dialogues in a screenplay that’s more episodic than emotionally stirring. Arjun in every frame. Moments by himself. Moments with Dr Deb (Jayant Kripalani) where at one moment Arjun’s intruding into the doc’s Sunday lunch at a restaurant and the next time he’s inside the doc’s house where the medical man cooks for him and banters with him. You’re supposed to guess that the patient has warmed his way into his doc’s heart.</p>
