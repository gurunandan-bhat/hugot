    <p>Viswam, directed by Sreenu Vaitla, is a reminder that not everything has changed for the better with mainstream Telugu cinema. In terms of narrative style, character arcs and the plot itself, this Gopichand and Kavya Thapar starrer feels redundant. The film teems with dozen of characters and a handful of sub plots — in the name of offering wholesome entertainment — with action episodes, romance, emotional drama and mindless comedy; it can get tiresome to sit through 155 minutes of an incoherence narrative, even if one does not look for logical reasoning.</p>
<p>The first few minutes sets the tone for what is in store. A terrorist who has infiltrated the political and academic circles in the Telugu states reveals his true colours when a student executes a bomb blast at a restaurant. The oft-explored India vs. Pakistan trope is further narrowed down to playing into religious sentiments. Even before the details can sink in, the story swiftly changes gear to show a politician being killed, and his brother becoming a puppet in the hands of the terrorist who is on a deadly mission.</p>
