    <p>There was a time, not long ago, when Hindi blockbuster cinema could stand on its own — distinguishable, say, from mythological soap operas and tacky non-fiction programming on satellite TV. But the laziness and opportunism of the last few years have all but vaporized that distinction. It leaves the theatre-going audience in two minds. Adipurush (2023) was laughably inept yet insistently pious and grim. The same applies to Singham Again, ostensibly an action potboiler and an Avengers-like ‘team-up’ movie but playing like an ad for the tourism ministry’s Ramayana trail.</p>
<p>Headlined by Ajay Devgn, this is the latest in director Rohit Shetty’s ever-expanding cop universe, preceded by two Singham films as well as the standalones Simmba(2018) and Sooryavanshi(2021). Near the start, a disclaimer informs us that, although the new film is inspired by the story of Lord Ram, “neither its narrative nor its characters should be viewed as revered deities”. This is a strange injunction to be imposed on a Rohit Shetty film: his protagonists, none more than sullen supercop Bajirao Singham, only make sense as revered deities. Solemn saintly hymns herald his every arrival. He is divinity incarnate, we’re told. When he sets foot inside a nightclub, in the new film, the DJ turns off the music — a thoroughly sensible move.</p>
