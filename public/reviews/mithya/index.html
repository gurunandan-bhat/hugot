    <p>Child Actors in Indian mainstream films, largely, follow an ancient repertoire. They emulate the sticky sweetness of store-bought fruit juice, hiding their characters&rsquo; deeper flavours under their affected cadence and countenance. Rarely assigned with weightier emotions like rage or grief, their ‘cinematic’ is confined to giggles, pouts or pulling long faces. In mainstream imagination, child personas offer little intellectual stimulation to the audience; they come devoid of any deeper meaning to decipher.</p>
<p>In Mithya, filmmaker Sumanth Bhat deviates from this convention to create an unusual child protagonist with an interiority. Mithun (Athish S Shetty) observes, feels and knows. He harbours secrets and grudges; he questions and reacts. The film opens with a shot of him standing at the doorway of a moving train compartment, with his back turned to the viewer. Throughout the film, he keeps turning away from the camera and people, refusing to obey or open up. This rebellion, you learn over the next couple of scenes, stems from shock and grief, among other emotions, that lie entangled in his psyche – his widowed mother killed herself recently, leading to his relocation from Mumbai – where he was born and brought up – to an Udupi village, under the guardianship of his late mother&rsquo;s sister and family. He tiptoes around the new home, eavesdropping on the elders’ conversations and watching them closely, trying to sniff out the truth about his losses. Bhat shadows him, the shallow-focused lensing underscoring the loneliness accumulated on the boy like mould.</p>
