    <p>In January 2022, the Netflix series Yeh Kaali Kaali Ankhein introduced us to an unusual drama. The show, set in a small town, revolved around Vikrant (Tahir Raj Bhasin), who uncomfortably finds himself to be the object of affection for a gangster politician&rsquo;s daughter Purva (Aanchal Singh). Instead of marrying his college sweetheart Shikha (Shweta Tripathi), he finds himself tied by matrimony to someone he doesn&rsquo;t love. Sidharth Sengupta&rsquo;s series took Vikrant to his limit as he found himself hiring a hitman to get rid of Purva. Now, nearly three years later, the series returns to pick up where it left off.</p>
<p>The second season is the next chapter in the tale focused entirely on Purva&rsquo;s kidnapping and the aftermath. The hitman (Arunoday Singh) demands a ransom, and soon everyone is involved. The new entrant to the series Guru (Gurmeet Choudhary) is a super spy who sees and knows all. So how does Vikrant manage to escape unscathed from this mess? The chess pieces move in the show, but they don&rsquo;t go very far.</p>
