    <p>Indian cinema in recent years has seen violent, high-octane action films attracting a larger audience. However, for those who grew up in the &rsquo;90s, rom-coms hold a special place in their hearts. Director Kiruthiga Udhayanidhi’s Kadhalikka Neramillai, starring Nithya Menen and Ravi Mohan, offers a respite from the flood of violent films released every week. But does Kadhalikka Neramillai have all the elements of a perfect rom-com? Let’s find out! Siddharth aka Sid (Ravi Mohan), a structural engineer, is a man against having kids. At his engagement, Nirupama (TJ Bhanu) fails to show up due to their differing ideologies. Shreya (Nithya Menen), an architect, is in love with Karan. After their marriage registry, he cheats on her. However, Shreya asks Karan for one last favor, and it’s not divorce. This leads to Shreya’s fun-filled meeting with now-single Sid.</p>
