    <p>When a man who wears his masculinity on his sleeve laments at how his son is growing up, displaying feminine traits, his wife tries to make him understand the importance of accepting an individual’s natural expression of gender. This segment and the portion that follows gives writer-director Hasith Goli’s Telugu film Swag the much-needed emotional anchor. Until then, the narrative is like a satire, with elements of farce and ‘absurd theatre’ as the several characters played by Sree Vishnu and the dual characters of Ritu Varma slug it out to assert the power of male versus female.</p>
<p>In his second directorial venture after Raja Raja Chora, Hasith Goli discusses gender equality beyond the binaries, through a non-linear story that goes back and forth from the 1550s to the present, revealing several stories of a bloodline in the process. The experimental narrative, steeped with quirky characters, can at times test patience, but is ultimately rewarding.</p>
