    <p>A privileged, entitled politician’s son (Prateik Smita Patil) has just shamed, blackmailed and attempted to molest a lady passenger when the famous blue bracelet appears out of the blue. It’s an energetic beginning with a touch of humour as Sanjay Rajkot (Salman Khan), also known as Sikandar and Raja Saab (yes, even in these times), thrashes the goon(s) while the air hostess announces turbulence. The man with the blue bracelet is charming too, when he asks the lady if she’s okay, in the midst of the fight scene. To refer to her past as closed and her little son as her future, gives a glimpse of contemporary chivalry. One wishes the same energy, the same today’s thought and the same sprinkling of wit had prevailed the rest of the way as outdated writer-director AR Murugadoss takes flights of fantasy to establish Sanjay/Sikandar/Raja Saab. A super wealthy “Rajkot Ka Raja” so large-hearted that the entire population will stand up to protect him, and no policeman dare touch him. One who sets out to arrest him for bashing up the minister’s son, has his jeep broken into pieces and he has to take the offer from smirking “Rani Sahiba” Saisri (Rashmika Mandanna) to use their private cars to return to the police station.</p>
