    <time datetime="2024-11-01T21:26:28&#43;05:30">November 1, 2024</time>

    <p>Of all the improbable things in Rohit Shetty’s Singham Again, like a car flying over a helicopter, like the same car landing without a scratch, like gifted actors dialling down their craft to match the trite script, like six people writing that script, like Ajay Devgn mistaking walking for acting, like the film mistaking walking for acting, the one that sticks out the most is Shetty assembling half the Hindi film industry (an exaggeration but you get the drift) to combat Arjun Kapoor.</p>
<p>It is a bewildering proposition on multiple grounds, the most obvious one being Kapoor’s inability to act. In a decade-long career, the actor has made his mark in sand, which is to say not much. His turns have been largely ineffective, wholly forgettable and tremendously non-committal. On a good day I would have termed it as art but today, when the memory of his film is still fresh in my post-Diwali mind, I want to call it a miracle.</p>
