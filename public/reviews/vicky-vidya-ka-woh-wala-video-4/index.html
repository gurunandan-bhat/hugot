    <p>Rajkummar Rao and Triptii Dimri’s latest release Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video is a social comedy that focuses on the length of the story more than logic. With a shorter, more crisp story the film would have managed to give the very serious and important message it wishes to. The film is a cautionary tale in the 1990s but the fear is very relevant and still prevalent given the growing use of AI, instead of finding a way to incorporate the fear throughout, the story focuses a bit too much on the comedy punch lines and hopes a long monologue will make up for the rest. But it doesn’t.</p>
<p>The film begins with Vicky and Vidya’s quirky wedding. Vicky is the biggest mehendi artist in the district and Vidya is an MBBS practitioner doctor. Their relationship and cast differences wouldn’t let them unite and they find a way around it by breaking her engagement publicly. Vicky then steps in as the righteous man to do the right thing for his neighbour and get married to Vidya, their original plan. While in written the scene is a cute introduction to their very common situation in the 90s, the film doesn’t do it justice.</p>
