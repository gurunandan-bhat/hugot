    <p>Actor and director Basil Joseph has been on a winning streak. He opened his account in 2025 with a crime thriller, Pravinkoodu Shappu, and followed it with Ponman, which is a family drama with a tinge of suspense. Ponman is adapted from GR Indugopan&rsquo;s novel titled Nalanchu Cheruppakar. And, it brilliantly captures the struggles of underdogs and how their lives are beyond materialistic things. Gold dealer PP Ajesh (Basil Joseph) lends 25 sovereigns of gold to Bruno&rsquo;s family for his sister Setti Graf&rsquo;s (Lijomole Jose) wedding. He signs an agreement with Steffi&rsquo;s family that he will take the money that is gifted to the bride. If the money didn&rsquo;t add up to the gold he lent, he would recover the jewellery to compensate. Bruno&rsquo;s impulsive behaviour leads to fewer people coming to Steffi&rsquo;s wedding and, eventually, they fall short of money.</p>
