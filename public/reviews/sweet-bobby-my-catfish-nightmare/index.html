    <p>Even seasoned true-crime documentary aficionados will be left perplexed and very, very uncomfortable by what unfolds in this recently released watch on Netflix. A large part of that has to do with the fact that Sweet Bobby: My Catfish Nightmare feels both relatable and ridiculous at the same time and brings to the fore the dark abyss that is the Internet as well as exposes the shocking depths that human apathy can plunge to.</p>
<p>Exploring a woman’s chilling catfishing experience, the 82-minute watch focuses on Kirat Assi, a well-educated London woman of Punjabi origin, who, after being in an eight-year-long online ‘relationship’ with a man who she fell hopelessly in love with, found out that it was an elaborate catfishing scam carried out by none other than her own female cousin!</p>
