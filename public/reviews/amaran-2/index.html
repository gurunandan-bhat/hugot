    <p>Gentleman cadet Mukund Varadarajan is marching along with his batchmates during his passing out parade. During this march, an animated Indhu Rebecca Varghese shouts out the name of the love of her life. She also runs around to catch a glimpse of Mukund, who is one among the soldiers passing out. GV Prakash Kumar’s rousing score primes the scene for a romantic high. She is jubilant, happy, ecstatic, and sports a smile that reaches her eyes as Mukund marches with a straight face.</p>
<p>And at the very last moment, as the march comes to a close, he finally has half a smile, even without looking at her. Now, is that smile for Indhu? Is he smiling because he has finished his training, and is living his long-time dream of joining the Indian army? Director Rajkumar Periasamy’s Amaran tells us that Mukund, after a point, didn’t really differentiate between the two, and that’s what makes his story all the more special.</p>
