    <p>Skydance Animation&rsquo;s second film, Spellbound, updates family dynamics in a modern way, letting kids know that sometimes happily ever after doesn&rsquo;t work out. Shrek director Vicky Jensen helms this refreshing but overlong story of a teenage girl trying to undo a spell on her parents that has turned them into literal monsters. The colourfully appealing but flat world of Lumbria makes way for a quest for the royal trio in this well-meaning musical.</p>
<p>Time is running out for 15-year-old Princess Ellian (voice of Rachel Zegler), as she must find a way to help her father King Solon (voice of Javier Bardem) and mother Queen Ellsmere (voice of Nicole Kidman). The teenager, who doesn&rsquo;t want to become queen herself so soon, takes her parents on a daring quest to reverse the spell&rsquo;s effects before her parents become monsters forever. Through the medium of music and magic, the family finds their way back to one another again.</p>
