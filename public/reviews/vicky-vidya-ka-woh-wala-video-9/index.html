    <p>Coming from a background in writing low-brow comedy skits for television, director Raaj Shaandilyaa has this knack for creating funny characters rooted in mofussil towns that generate mirth by engaging in rollicking repartees. His broad humour emanates from deep observation and understanding of the cultural mores of a conservative society coming to terms with socio-economic liberalisation in the 1990s. However, Shaandilya’s skill to combine the comic sketches into a wholesome screenplay is still a work in progress, resulting in a disappointing outcome.</p>
<p>In Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video, the protagonist is a male mehendi artist, a ubiquitous figure in the neighbourhood who is seldom celebrated. Set in Rishikesh when it was part of Uttar Pradesh, the film follows Vicky (Rajkummar Rao) as he gets married to Vidya (Triptii Dimri) despite a mismatch in the hierarchy of their professions. He makes designs on women’s hands and she, being a doctor, keeps a check on people’s pulse. Overcome by a strange urge or perhaps a fad that echoes the current digital generation’s eagerness to record even the most intimate moments for posterity, they decide to make a video of their first night for their pleasure.</p>
