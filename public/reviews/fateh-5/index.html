    <p>Fateh marked Sonu Soodâ€™s directional debut as well as his first all-out lead action role. The film attempts to talk about social issues as well as presents a hero with a bad boy image but has good intentions. With easy and comic dialogues the film does have much to offer to easy-going audience and can be relatable despite the action-heavy extravagant plot. Sonu Sood also gets a chance to show off his charm but his stoic demeanour works for him more. The film kicks off with an action packed scene where Sood walks into a room full of gangsters working for the cyber mafia and takes them down effortlessly. Though the scene is long it does brings one of the best action sequences in the film. Sood looks effortless during the action sequences even when the camera is slow to track the movements. The plot however takes a flashback as Sood is taken down recalling his life and his mission.</p>
