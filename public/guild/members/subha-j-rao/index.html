    <p>Subha J Rao has loved the movies since she sat in a darkened makeshift auditorium as a child and watched a K Balachander classic come alive on a white cloth that doubled up as a screen. A journalist with over 27 years of experience, she has worked in The Indian Express and United News of India, New Delhi, from 1997 to 2002. She then joined The Hindu and had two stints there, from November 2002 to February 2015 and from January 2016 to May 2017.</p>
<p>She lives in Mangalore, and you can catch her on Friday mornings reviewing Tamizh and Kannada films with her handbag for company. She specialises in interviews, and loves to bring alive the person behind the personality. She currently writes for The News Minute, Ott Play, The Federal and The Hindu. Previous bylines are at Firstpost, Film Companion, News9 and Silverscreenindia.com.</p>
