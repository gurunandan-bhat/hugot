        <h2><a href="/reviews/call-me-bae/">Call Me Bae</a></h2>
        
        <p>In Bella Chowdhary’s world, there’s no such thing as too many bags and in a world of fakes, she is on a path to become a Birkin. But it’s a path that she hasn’t chosen for herself, rather, a tragedy has led her there.</p>
<p>Bella AKA Bae (Ananya Panday) was born with a golden spoon in a Delhi-based wealthy family. Upon the brink of losing their wealth, the family hacks Bae’s love story with a business tycoon Agastya Chowdhary (Vihaan Samat). But everything that glitters is not gold. She may have all the luxuries one can ever wish for, but none of them fulfilling enough to help her cope with her loneliness. Her world comes crashing down when a rather private moment becomes a public affair.</p>

        <p>In Taaza Khabar Season 2, there’s little that’s taaza (fresh). There’s ambition, but not enough drive. There are those next big things, but not the smoothest ways forward. A show, often oscillating between past, present and future, lacks the ‘vardaan’ (blessing) of staying afloat - something that, both the series and Bhuvan Bam’s character Vasant Gawde desperately need.</p>
<p>Those who’ve watched the first season will understand when we say - far bizarre things happen to Gawde in the follow-up. In the first season, a sanitation worker stumbles upon his magical powers of getting updates about future events and his life changes overnight. But everything that rises must eventually have a downfall. The new season takes off from where the last one ended - only this time, the ‘taaza khabar’ is that of Vasya dying. Will he rise from the dead? Or can he possibly avert his death?</p>

        <h2><a href="/reviews/jigra-17/">Jigra</a></h2>
        
        <p>Will the real &lsquo;Jigra&rsquo; please stand up? In Vasant Bala&rsquo;s film, Vedang Raina might be portraying the titular character, but it&rsquo;s Alia Bhatt, who is the heart and soul of the film. Turns out she is a shield not just for her brother, but also for the movie, even as the revenge thriller rests too heavily on Bhatt.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a girl who had to grow up a little sooner than you&rsquo;d like. She lost her mother when she was young and her father took his own life. It&rsquo;s now on her to parent her brother Ankur. The two siblings are taken in by a relative family - while Satya works as a staff in their home, Ankur is an engineer with an idea waiting to be pitched to his uncle. All through it, Satya is the one who looks out for Ankur and wants to protect him from all the evils of the world. But fate had other plans. Ankur lands up in jail in a foreign land (a fictional Hanshi Dao) on false charges of drug possession. The clock is ticking as the court pronounces the death penalty for Ankur. It&rsquo;s a race against time for Satya who can now go to any lengths to free her younger brother or as she calls him, her &lsquo;jigra&rsquo;.</p>
