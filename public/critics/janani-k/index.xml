      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was 2019. It was when actor Prithviraj Sukumaran turned director for the first time. When Lucifer, starring Mohanlal, one of the big Ms of Mollywood, hit theatres, it transcended borders. Lucifer found love not just in Kerala, but in other parts of the country, thanks to its layered storyline, which helped audiences find new details with every re-watch. Five years later, Lucifer&amp;rsquo;s sequel Empuraan has hit theatres with a big budget and bigger expectations. Kerala Chief Minister Jathin Ramdas (Tovino Thomas) is facing multiple charges of corruption and failure to uphold the values of his late father Ramdas (Sachin Khedekar). Meanwhile, the people of Kerala are disappointed, and he is facing opposition from a new political party with Hindutva ideals. Then there is Khuresh Ab&amp;rsquo;raam (Mohanlal), with his mysterious persona tackling the Kabuka clan. The local unrest in Kerala and the dwindling political climate make room for Ab&amp;rsquo;raam&amp;rsquo;s entry into the state to set things straight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What happens when a mistake you commit uproots the life of an already struggling person? How do you overcome this? Does it make you realise your mistake or does it push you into the depths of depression? Director Ashwath Marimuthu&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Dragon&amp;rsquo; is a film that provides definite answers to these questions. D Ragavan (Pradeep Ranganathan), a archetypal &amp;lsquo;good boy&amp;rsquo;, is a gold medallist in school. He confesses his love to a girl after he gets awarded the gold medal.

Cut to his college days, D Ragavan becomes Dragon because of the rejection and has 48 standing arrears. What he earned in college was the love of Keerthi (Anupama Parameswaran).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few minutes into director Sreejith Babu&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Painkili&amp;rsquo;, you see a petite Sheeba Baby (Anaswara Rajan) jumping off the terrace and eloping from home after being pressured into marriage.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indian films about same-sex love are far and few. The ones with the right portrayal of homosexuals are even fewer. Director Jayaprakash Radhakrishnan&amp;rsquo;s recent release, Kadhal Enbadhu Podhu Udamai, is the latest entrant to the list of films on queer love. Starring Lijomol, Anusha Prabhu, Vineeth and Rohini, the film is a deeply moving and heartwarming film about love that goes beyond boundaries, societal acceptance, prejudice and personal traumas. Kadhal Enbadhu Podhu Udamai begins with Sam (Lijomol Jose) having a heartfelt chat with her mother Lakshmi (Rohini Molleti). She confesses that she is in love and Lakshmi suggests she take the &amp;lsquo;man&amp;rsquo; home for lunch on a Sunday. Lakshmi conveys the news to her estranged husband Devararaj (Vineeth) and asks him to join them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ajith Kumar, the man of many talents, made the country proud with his Dubai racing win. But on the film front, his fans have been patiently waiting for over two years, asking for update after update. Finally, February 6 is the day when Vidaamuyarchi hits theatres across the globe. As Magizh Thirumeni promised, Vidaamuyarchi is not the usual run-of-the-mill commercial action entertainer but a full-blown thriller that does justice to the genre. As the title card rolls with Vidaamuyarchi - Perseverance Triumphs on the big screen, you can’t help but ask if perseverance has truly triumphed this time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Actor and director Basil Joseph has been on a winning streak. He opened his account in 2025 with a crime thriller, Pravinkoodu Shappu, and followed it with Ponman, which is a family drama with a tinge of suspense. Ponman is adapted from GR Indugopan&amp;rsquo;s novel titled Nalanchu Cheruppakar. And, it brilliantly captures the struggles of underdogs and how their lives are beyond materialistic things. Gold dealer PP Ajesh (Basil Joseph) lends 25 sovereigns of gold to Bruno&amp;rsquo;s family for his sister Setti Graf&amp;rsquo;s (Lijomole Jose) wedding. He signs an agreement with Steffi&amp;rsquo;s family that he will take the money that is gifted to the bride. If the money didn&amp;rsquo;t add up to the gold he lent, he would recover the jewellery to compensate. Bruno&amp;rsquo;s impulsive behaviour leads to fewer people coming to Steffi&amp;rsquo;s wedding and, eventually, they fall short of money.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Actor Manikandan is steadily becoming a bankable actor in Tamil cinema. His last two films, Good Night and Lover, turned out to be crowd favourites. In both films, he played a relatable &amp;lsquo;guy next door&amp;rsquo; dealing with financial and emotional problems. Director Rajeshwar Kalisamy&amp;rsquo;s Kudmbasthan is yet another film that features Manikandan in the role of a breadwinner in a lower-middle-class family man. Naveen (Manikandan) and Vennila (Saanve Megghana) get married at a registrar&amp;rsquo;s office, with their families cursing them for not getting their permission. After a brief hiatus, Naveen and Vennila live with his parents. Vennila, an IAS aspirant, is a cool-headed, understanding and pregnant wife, who supports Naveen and turns a blind eye to the insults of her mother-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Malayalam superstar Mammootty and his film choices in the last couple of years have been incredible and eye-opening.

And when he chooses to join hands with Tamil filmmaker Gautham Menon, it certainly excites every film buff who has followed their career paths. Has Dominic and The Ladies’ Purse lived up to expectations? Let’s find out! Dominic (Mammootty) is a former police officer who now runs a detective agency. He is a laid-back guy with a quirky sense of humour. As he undergoes some financial issues, his landlady gives him a task to find the owner of a purse she found. In return, she will waive the rent.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indian cinema in recent years has seen violent, high-octane action films attracting a larger audience. However, for those who grew up in the &amp;rsquo;90s, rom-coms hold a special place in their hearts. Director Kiruthiga Udhayanidhi’s Kadhalikka Neramillai, starring Nithya Menen and Ravi Mohan, offers a respite from the flood of violent films released every week. But does Kadhalikka Neramillai have all the elements of a perfect rom-com? Let’s find out! Siddharth aka Sid (Ravi Mohan), a structural engineer, is a man against having kids. At his engagement, Nirupama (TJ Bhanu) fails to show up due to their differing ideologies. Shreya (Nithya Menen), an architect, is in love with Karan. After their marriage registry, he cheats on her. However, Shreya asks Karan for one last favor, and it’s not divorce. This leads to Shreya’s fun-filled meeting with now-single Sid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You know which movie it is from, the dialogue by heart, and yet it brings laughter every time you watch. Now, imagine watching a typical Sundar C film, which is known for its comedy, 12 years after it was actually made. Madha Gaja Raja follows the story of Raja (Vishal) attending a wedding at his school teacher&amp;rsquo;s house, where he reunites with his school gang. One of his friends (Santhanam) is going through marriage issues, while the other two are involved in a case that concerns business tycoon Karkuvel Vishwanath (Sonu Sood).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the 25 years of his career, director Bala has created quite a niche for himself. His films are far from the &amp;lsquo;ideal&amp;rsquo; moral compass or political correctness. Violence or murder is a form of justice in most of his films, while death acts as a liberation for some of his characters. With 10 films to his credit, director Bala is back with Vanangaan, after the disastrous Varmaa, which is a remake of the Telugu superhit film, Arjun Reddy. Vanangaan follows the story of Koti (Arun Vijay) and Devi (Ridha), a brother-sister duo living a content life in Kanniyakumari. While Koti, who is hearing and speech impaired, does odd jobs to put money on the table, Devi works at a tattoo studio. Koti joins as a security guard at an orphanage where many visually impaired people live. An untoward incident happens and Koti gets to know about it. He takes up violence to offer justice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He is an honest, upright officer who doesn’t bend to corruption. As a high-ranking official, he wants to make Visakhapatnam corruption-free. Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Bobbili Satyamurthy (Srikanth), who so far has corrupted the government, undergoes a transformation and instructs his sons, Mopidevi (SJ Suryah) and Maavera Munimanikam (Jayaram), and his ministers to stop favouring anyone and run a corruption-free government for the next year while they remain in power.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As an actor, he explores different genres, and despite his limitations, Balaji pushes the boundaries with the scripts he chooses. Director Sidharth Vishwanath&amp;rsquo;s Sorgavaasal is one such film that highlights the 1999 riots and presents a gripping prison-break drama. Parthiban (RJ Balaji), hailing from a lower-economic background, runs a food cart. Shanmugam (Param), an IAS officer who frequents Parthiban&amp;rsquo;s food cart, helps him secure a loan to open a hotel in his locality.

With Kanguva, Suriya and producer KE Gnanavel Raja made tall claims about the film’s success even before its release. While Gnanavel claimed that the film would rake in Rs 2,000 crore worldwide, Suriya went all out in promoting the film. But, has the film lived up to the massive expectations that the team set for themselves? Let’s find out! Kanguva’s story connects the past and present in two parallel timelines. Francis (Suriya) is a bounty hunter in 2024. He meets a child who reminds him of his past. A thousand years earlier, Kanga aka Kanguva (Suriya), a prince of the tribe, is facing one conflict after another.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Films with a military background, most times, evoke strong feelings in one’s heart. Not just that, it’s a constant reminder that the army men are toiling in difficult terrain just to keep everyone safe. And when Amaran, a biopic on the life of Major Mukund Varadarajan, was announced, it piqued everyone’s interest. The expectations rose sky-high when Sivakarthikeyan, who has so far done boy-next-door roles, was roped in to headline the film. For the unversed, Amaran is an adaptation of the book series, India’s Most Fearless: True Stories of Modern Military Heroes by Shiv Aroor and Rahul Singh. Mukund Varadarajan (Sivakarthikeyan) has his goals set right from fifth standard. A field trip to the Officers Training Academy (OTA) in Chennai sowed the seeds of joining the military in him. Years later, while pursuing his graduation at Madras Christian College, he meets his ladylove Indhu Rebecca Varghese (Sai Pallavi). They fall head over heels in love with each other. For Indhu, she has to love Mukund and his passion as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fortune favours the brave – this is a slogan that aptly encapsulates what Lucky Baskhar is. Director Venky Atluri’s latest outing, far different from his previous offerings, is this year’s Diwali gift to the audience. Lucky Baskhar is a film about how a middle-class man, who aims for the sky, gets derailed due to greed, but is clever enough to pull him out of the mess. Sounds interesting, doesn’t it? Baskhar (Dulquer Salmaan) is a cashier in Magadha Bank. He is the sole breadwinner of his family, which consists of his wife Sumathi (Meenakshi Chaudhary), son Karthik (Rithvik), his ailing dad, brother and sister. They’re on the edge of poverty and debts strangle him. At that time, Anthony (Ramki), a man who wants a loan from Baskhar’s bank, comes up with an offer that he can’t refuse due to his familial circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In Jai Bhim, despite having Suriya onboard, he played more of a supporting role to brilliant Manikandan and Lijomol Jose. His third film, Vettaiyan, features Rajinikanth, but the director promises to have a solid story that champions Thalaivar. Will Gnanavel be able to strike a balance? Let&amp;rsquo;s find out! Athiyan (Rajinikanth), Superintendent of Police, is all about successfully carrying out encounters against criminals. He believes that killing a person is justice for those who were wronged and is not willing to wait for the law to take its course. Sathyadev (Amitabh Bachchan), a retired judge, bats against extrajudicial killings. A police case and a major misjudgement by Athiyan bring him face-to-face with Sathyadev.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How does one lead a life when you forget your routine and even the mere existence of your loved ones? Bougainvillea, directed by Amal Neerad, is a film that revolves around a couple, Royce (Kunchacko Boban) and Reethu (Jyothirmayi), that gives you an insight into a pair that is trying to overcome this kind of an unusual situation. In the initial few seconds, we see Royce and Reethu meet with a nasty accident. The after-effect of the accident: Reethu suffers from Anterograde and Retrograde amnesia. Reethu&amp;rsquo;s life is defined by Royce&amp;rsquo;s ideas. Her day-to-day routine and details about her family are written in a diary. And house help Rema (Srinda) oversees her at home when Royce, a doctor, is at the hospital. One day, David Koshy (Fahadh Faasil) turns up at Reethu&amp;rsquo;s home and asks her about the whereabouts of a missing girl. His interrogation hits a roadblock because of Reethu&amp;rsquo;s memory. But, there&amp;rsquo;s more than what meets the eye.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jr NTR, fondly called the &amp;lsquo;Man of the Masses&amp;rsquo; by his fans, is back as a solo lead after six years, choosing director Koratala Siva&amp;rsquo;s Devara (now a two-part film) for his big moment. Devara explores the theme of fear and its impact on an entire generation. Fear is the strongest emotion in Devara, but how is this translated into a cohesive script? Let&amp;rsquo;s find out! Set in 1996, the story follows a police officer (Ajay), who along with his team are on the hunt for criminals, Daya and Yethi. Their investigation leads them to Singappa (Prakash Raj), who lives in Errasamudram (Red Sea) and recounts the story of Devara (NTR) and Bhaira (Saif Ali Khan). Cut to the 1970s, Devara is a righteous man, who thinks twice before taking a life, while Bhaira, on the other hand, is brutal and kills without hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The Greatest of All Time&amp;rsquo; aka &amp;lsquo;GOAT&amp;rsquo; is Thalapathy Vijay&amp;rsquo;s penultimate film before he fully commits to politics. Tracing his career, one would truly understand why &amp;lsquo;GOAT&amp;rsquo; is probably the perfect title for Vijay. Director Venkat Prabhu&amp;rsquo;s spy thriller further establishes Thalapathy Vijay as truly &amp;rsquo;the greatest of all time&amp;rsquo;. Gandhi (Vijay), along with Sunil (Prashanth), Kalyan (Prabhudheva) and Ajay (Ajmal Ameer), forms the Special Anti-Terrorism Squad (SATS), led by Nasser (Jayaram). A fun and efficient team, they get the job done without much hassle. However, when Gandhi takes his pregnant wife (Sneha) and son Jeevan on a mission to Thailand, he faces a tragic loss, prompting him to seek a less risky job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watching a neatly woven commercial cinema is therapeutic in every sense. And when it is headlined by powerhouse performers, Nani and SJ Suryah, you know you&amp;rsquo;re in for a treat. &amp;lsquo;Saripodhaa Sanivaaram&amp;rsquo; marks Nani and director Vivek Athreya&amp;rsquo;s second collaboration after &amp;lsquo;Ante Sundaraniki&amp;rsquo;. While &amp;lsquo;Ante Sundariniki&amp;rsquo; was a cute rom-com, Nani and Vivek went all out for &amp;lsquo;Saripodhaa Sanivaaram&amp;rsquo; by picking a masala entertainer with a family backdrop. Surya (Nani) is a loved elder child to his parents (Abhirami and Sai Kumar). But, his anger is his problem. His mother, who is counting her days, teaches him a unique way to keep his anger in check and let it out only on Saturdays. Surya makes note of people who wronged him on the rest of the days and gets time to process his anger till Saturday. And when he feels his anger is justified, he thrashes the people who angered him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Director Mari Selvaraj, on several occasions, called ‘Vaazhai’ his best film. He stated that it was the film he wanted to make first, before ‘Pariyerum Perumal’, ‘Karnan’ and ‘Maamannan’. ‘Vaazhai’ is a biographical film that explores a significant incident that changed Mari’s life. Mari is absolutely right, as ‘Vaazhai’ is his career-best film and a perfect answer to the trolls that targeted him. Sivanaindhan (Ponvel), with his charismatic and innocent smile, lives with his mother (Janaki) and elder sister Vembu (Dhivya Duraisamy). Sivanaindhan juggles between school and working at a banana plantation over weekends to make ends meet. He excels at school, consistently achieving first rank, but he does not enjoy working at the plantation for obvious reasons. The strenuous labour and the way he’s ripped off of his childish joys take a toll on him. But, Sivanaindhan understands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Director Pa Ranjith is one filmmaker with a powerful voice in Tamil cinema. Whether one agrees or not, his voice is significant and cannot be ignored. When he announced his collaboration with actor Chiyaan Vikram in 2021, it excited many. And the excitement grew multifold over the years and became one of the most anticipated films of 2024. Did &amp;lsquo;Thangalaan&amp;rsquo; manage to fulfil the expectations? Let&amp;rsquo;s find out! Thangalaan (Chiyaan Vikram), Gangamma (Parvathy Thiruvothu) and their five children live in North Arcot where they rely on agriculture. However, their land is grabbed by the upper-class landlord using deceitful tactics. In the 1800s, Lord Clement, a British General, expressed his desire to trace gold near their village. However, a local myth claims that the sorceress Aarathi (Malavika Mohanan), guards the area. Thangalaan and the rest of the villagers believe in the myth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Keerthy Suresh&amp;rsquo;s teaser and trailer for Raghuthatha were released on social media, they generated a positive buzz around the film. The intriguingly cut trailer suggested that the film would address Hindi imposition in Tamil Nadu. Additionally, Kayavizhi’s (Keerthy Suresh) attempt to challenge patriarchy with her bold and upfront attitude piqued everyone’s interest. Did Suman Kumar manage to weave a successful story around these two sensitive topics? Let’s find out! Kayal (Keerthy Suresh) and her grandfather (MS Bhaskar) protest against Hindi imposition and are responsible for shutting down the Hindi organisation Ekta Sabha in their village, Valluvanpettai. She is a feminist who slams everyone who says, “ponna adaka odukama iru” (Be coy and obedient like a woman). One day, her grandfather’s cancer diagnosis and his three wishes push her towards marriage, which she has never been interested in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;South Queen&amp;rsquo; Trisha Krishnan forayed into OTT with the Telugu web series, &amp;lsquo;Brinda&amp;rsquo;, directed by Surya Manoj Vangala. While the web series started premiering on SonyLIV on August 2, there have been low-key promotions for whatever reason. At a time when there are many web series on multiple platforms, &amp;lsquo;Brinda&amp;rsquo; stands apart. This is truly one of the web shows that deserves more promotion. Brinda (Trisha Krishnan) is a newly appointed sub-inspector, who is moody and hardly gets treated as equals at the police station. She goes to work, struggles to sleep and is quite smart. When her superiors, including Sarathi (Ravindra Vijay), want to close a murder case as suicide, she smartly points out that it&amp;rsquo;s a murder. This smart work lands her in trouble as her boss always tries to put her in place because she&amp;rsquo;s a woman. But Brinda is someone who will not take it with a pinch of salt. She teaches him a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;28 years ago, director Shankar and Kamal Haasan gifted &amp;lsquo;Indian&amp;rsquo; to the Tamil audience, who still celebrate it like it&amp;rsquo;s their own. Almost three decades later, the film (read: corruption) still remains relevant. But, Kamal Haasan and Shankar wanted to bring back Indian thatha (grandfather) aka Senapathy to brush up on all the corrupt activities that we&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far in umpteen movies, not just in Tamil cinema but across other languages. Chitra Aravindan (Siddharth) and his three friends run a YouTube channel called &amp;lsquo;Barking Dogs,&amp;rsquo; which focuses on parodies and political satire. They end their calls with &amp;lsquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s bark!&amp;rsquo; (If you think this is absurd, hold your horses). After realising that their videos, despite receiving lakhs of views, had little impact on the audience, the team starts a campaign called &amp;lsquo;Come Back Indian.&amp;rsquo; According to them, only Indian Thatha, aka Senapathy, could put an end to corruption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was 2015 when SS Rajamouli&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Baahubali&amp;rsquo; was released and blew everyone&amp;rsquo;s mind. To this day, the two &amp;lsquo;Baahubali&amp;rsquo; films not only shattered box office records but also set a benchmark for films of the same ilk. Nealy a decade later, director Nag Ashwin, with monumental ambitions, gifted &amp;lsquo;Kalki 2898 AD&amp;rsquo;, set in a dystopian world. With futuristic ideas coupled with Hindu mythology, the film will surely blow your mind, just like &amp;lsquo;Baahubali&amp;rsquo; did. Thousands of years after the Mahabharata war, Kashi became the last city of the world. And the world is ruled by Supreme Yaskin (Kamal Haasan), who is waiting for a magical serum to gain powers. The poor suffer in the city, while the rich enjoy their lives in the Complex, a place built for the privileged. It is Bhairava&amp;rsquo;s (Prabhas) dream to make it to the Complex. He is a bounty hunter doing petty jobs to earn the units that will enable him to earn his place in the Complex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
