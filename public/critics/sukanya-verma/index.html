        <h2><a href="/reviews/sikandar-3/">Sikandar</a></h2>
        
        <p>They&rsquo;re red carpets laid out by formula-favouring filmmakers for &lsquo;Bhai&rsquo; to strut around in slow motion and assert his stardom to indulgent fans again and again and again. But surely, even the most accommodating Bhai bhakts have a breaking point, especially when the red carpet resembles a tattered rug trod on by a hubris high superstar wearing sunglasses so shiny he cannot read the writing on the wall: STOP. There&rsquo;s not any effort — not even a smidgen — to resurrect a superstar on the wane in Sikandar by A R Murugadoss. Instead, you get dialogues like &lsquo;Insaaf nahi saaf karna hai.&rsquo; Four writer credits (Murugadoss, Rajat Aroraa, Hussain Dalal, Abbas Dalal) and this is what they came up with?</p>

        <p>The Diplomat begins with a disclaimer so lengthy, someone at the press show quipped &lsquo;interval&rsquo; at the end. Among many, many, MANY things, it makes a point to mention that the movie, which is based on the true story of Indian citizen Uzma Ahmed, is neither a biopic nor a documentary, neither condones nor endorses the views put forward and so on and so forth. In 2017, Uzma became national news when she sought the Indian high commission&rsquo;s help to get her out of Pakistan. The media documented her tears, trauma and thank you on television as she sat between then external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and then deputy high commissioner in Islamabad J P Singh recounting her story. There&rsquo;s significant cinematic value to her harrowing experiences and Writer Ritesh Shah and Director Shivam Nair dig into it to recreate the drama, if not the danger.</p>

        <p>Abhishek Bachchan is shaping into quite a father figure. From playing one to his real-life &lsquo;Paa&rsquo; Amitabh Bachchan wherein the latter&rsquo;s progeria condition ages him dramatically to the point of infirmity, an estranged dad of a precocious kid he reunites with under curious circumstances in Ludo, a divorced daddy surviving medical issues of the life-threatening kind while navigating a bumpy relationship with his daughter in I Want to Talk to a single dad of a smart-alecky princess harbouring dancer dreams in Be Happy, Abhishek has embarked on quite a few journeys where his parenting skills are put to test. Unlike the textbook Papas trickling with emotional wisdom and snuggly warmth, Abhishek&rsquo;s silently supportive approach, playful sarcasm and sparingly expressed authority conveys a father figuring it out as he goes along.</p>

        <p>Colleges are swanky theme parks for fashion and filmi romances in Karan Johar&rsquo;s universe. From Kuch Kuch Hota Hai to Student of the Year, the coolness quotient in his depiction is a no-expense-spared fantasy we continue to live in vicariously. No wonder his more hand-me-down home productions and streaming offshoots have no desire to escape its allure. Only the pretty leans heavily towards plastic in Nadaniyaan, the Netflix campus romance directed by his Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahaani assistant Shauna Gautam based on Riva Razdan Kapoor&rsquo;s story. Desperate high schooler striking a mutually beneficial deal with a fellow student to play her pretend boyfriend for a few days until they actually fall in love causing complications is a done-to-death Hollywood trope.</p>

        <h2><a href="/reviews/dabba-cartel/">Dabba Cartel</a></h2>
        
        <p>Renowned American jeweller Harry Winston once sent a precious diamond in an ordinary brown package by registered mail as he felt the less attention it draws, the more secure its delivery. Watching the women of Dabba Cartel casually supply dope all across the city of Mumbai as part of their tiffin courier service has a similar aplomb to it. In a shrewd but simple touch, there’s a bindi to tell regular lunch boxes from the suspect ones and avoid the chance of mix-up. Using everyday domestic imagery to camouflage an illegal enterprise is their masterstroke move but more than the trick, its the compulsions and challenges driving each of these five women that gives Dabba Cartel its spunk to a certain degree.</p>

        <h2><a href="/reviews/mere-husband-ki-biwi-4/">Mere Husband Ki Biwi</a></h2>
        
        <p>Between done-to-death tropes and flimsily updated ones, Mere Husband Ki Biwi sticks to ancient formulae yet gives a semblance of keeping up with the times only to confirm that old habits die hard. In Mudassar Aziz&rsquo;s routine rom-com, a divorcee dangles between his fiery ex and doting fiancée sparking off a battle for one-upmanship. It starts like a cheesy David Dhawan comedy salvaged by Govinda&rsquo;s inimitable lunacy back in the day and advances into a My Best Friend&rsquo;s Wedding rehash sans the deliciousness of Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz&rsquo;s jell-o pitted against creme brulee. Except this return to the 1990s style of whimsy evokes more nausea than nostalgia with its drab humour and out of sync performances.</p>

        <h2><a href="/reviews/anuja-2/">Anuja</a></h2>
        
        <p>Anuja begins with a girl telling her tween sibling a Panchatantra story about how a faithful mongoose saved a farmer&rsquo;s child from a poisonous snake yet was mistaken for an attacker because of his master&rsquo;s impetuous impulses. Making a thoughtful decision is central to writer-director Adams J Graves&rsquo; Oscar-nominated live-action short film &ndash; backed by the likes of Guneet Monga, Mindy Kaling and Priyanka Chopra Jones &ndash; about a pair of orphaned sisters inhabiting Delhi&rsquo;s grimy, shabby slums.</p>

        <h2><a href="/reviews/mrs/">Mrs</a></h2>
        
        <p>Few films have boiled my blood like Jeo Baby&rsquo;s The Great Indian Kitchen, which documents the daily drudgery a nameless, newly-married young woman undergoes as patriarchy claims another soul. Every single day, it&rsquo;s the same routine. She cooks and serves all the meals, sweeps and mops the floor, washes the utensils and the clothes in a household whose men are only too happy to thrust down their ideas of a domestic goddess and shun any external assistance &ndash; help or home appliances. What plays out is a portrait of misery in monotony, imagine a reverse Perfect Days, wherein director Wim Wenders discovers poetry in the fixed pattern of a toilet cleaner in Tokyo as he goes about his daily chores and banal schedule across a gentle, meditative rhythm.</p>

        <h2><a href="/reviews/baby-john-2/">Baby John</a></h2>
        
        <p>You know a movie is on shaky grounds when you find yourself agreeing with a sidekick who scoffs at the hero&rsquo;s swagger, &lsquo;Kahe ka Bachchan? Machhar aaya hai. Massal daal.&rsquo; Truth be told, Varun Dhawan&rsquo;s good egg energy makes it hard to buy him as an indomitable hulk single-handedly taking on a battalion of goons and serving justice without worrying about the consequences. The amount of loud music and dramatic mood (rain, thunder, fire) gone in to make the actor look formidable is telling enough of how unsuitable he&rsquo;s for the job. Directed by his assistant Kalees, Baby John is a scene-to-scene remake of Atlee&rsquo;s Tamil hit, Theri with a couple of inconsequential tweaks and a superstar cameo that didn&rsquo;t do anything for Singham Again and doesn&rsquo;t do anything for this one either. Even if you haven&rsquo;t watched Theri, which is purely fan service for Vijay fans, you wouldn&rsquo;t miss out on anything. There&rsquo;s no dearth of potboilers recycling the same old masala over the decades.</p>

        <h2><a href="/reviews/the-sabarmati-report-2/">The Sabarmati Report</a></h2>
        
        <p>News is the truth that you choose to bring out, a cunning television journalist tells her artless subordinate early on in The Sabarmati Report. She&rsquo;s the villain of the piece for concealing inconvenient realities and conveying only what suits her purpose and politics. Funny how The Sabarmati Report&rsquo;s poorly crafted propaganda masquerading as a crusade for justice is nothing but a blatant embodiment of these very ideals.</p>
<p>Directed by Dheeraj Sarna (after he took over from its original director Ranjit Chandel over differences in creative vision), this is an embarrassing work of bias inspired by the horrific events of February 27, 2002 when a fire in a train compartment of the Sabarmati Express killed 59 kar sevaks returning from Ayodhya at the Godhra railway station in Gujarat.</p>

        <p>Just like the earlier two Bhool Bhulaiyaa movies, kickstarted by Priyadarshan in 2007, the third of the horror comedy series by Director Anees Bazmee revolves around a phony psychic caught in the family drama of a haunted haveli. Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 opens like one of those The Mummy preludes unfolding a dark history from 200 years ago only to cut to the present, signalling at the wicked all the wrongdoing has unleashed, which Ruhaan aka Rooh Baba&rsquo;s (Kartik Aaryan) goofball ghostbuster must put an end to by hook or crook.</p>

        <p>Dressed in the exact same attire as her newly wedded sister at her reception, the lookalike twin poses right next to the bride and groom as if fulfilling Bollywood&rsquo;s bawdy fantasy of saali aadhi gharwali in a tasteless, thunder-stealing move.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rare tantalising moment in a pile of trite twists and turns where Do Patti, directed by Shashanka Chaturvedi, gives in to its basest impulses but collapses like a house of cards when it aims to be clever, or worse still, a crusader.</p>

        <h2><a href="/reviews/jigra-3/">Jigra</a></h2>
        
        <p>Vasan Bala creates worlds that may appear deceptively similar to the ones you and I inhabit but run entirely on their own terms and whimsy. It&rsquo;s a part of the film-maker&rsquo;s charm and cinephile influences, which made the likes of Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota and Monica O My Darling such a treat. Jigra, probably his most big-ticket project so far, is also his most sombre.</p>
<p>More than nods to pop culture moments, he internalises one of its biggest icons, Amitabh Bachchan, as both emotion and grammar. Bachchan, on whose 82nd birthday the movie releases, is Jigra&rsquo;s language, inspiration, attitude and plan B. But Bala is going more for the man&rsquo;s simmer than swagger and the representative of those angry young ideals is not some towering masculine figure but a pocket-sized Alia Bhatt determined to bring her incarcerated brother back home.</p>

        <p>Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video has the eagerness of a standup comic. It is the sort of movie that feels obliged to make a joke before a sentence, between a sentence and after a sentence. Problem is the humour is not just pedestrian, it&rsquo;s also plain unfunny. It&rsquo;s a joke, Manjot Singh in a cameo points out early on in Director Raaj Shaandilyaa&rsquo;s first comedy outside the Dream Girl franchise, as though embarrassingly aware of how unamusing the whole shtick is.</p>

        <p>Unsettling, isn&rsquo;t it? Our most reliable source of information and communication can be programmed to keep tabs on our mind and movement across the multiple devices that have become indispensable crutches of modern living. But then the Internet has always been a seductive, if not secure, space where all its gifts come with its share of dangers.</p>
<p>From sharing personal details about oneself on chats with complete strangers, unwittingly downloading software that gives clear passage to malware and bugs, falling prey to sophisticated phishing scams or divulging private data every single time we thoughtlessly tick a Terms and Conditions checkbox, there&rsquo;s a constant element of risk and ruin in romancing the gods of cyberspace. Technology&rsquo;s curse and boon remains the same. It advances but the problem is never in its possibilities as much as the greed of its wielder, which conditions us to believe if you&rsquo;re not in, you&rsquo;re out.</p>
