        <p>Netflix&rsquo;s The Life List is designed as a tearjerker but doesn&rsquo;t really push any exceptional buttons while trying to reach viewers&rsquo; emotions. Sofia Carson plays Alex, a young woman either in her late 20s or early 30s who gets her kick in life from her dead mother. Alex supposedly becomes a grownup in the course of the feature; however, it feels as if the film is pushing too hard to make us feel without actually showing us why. The film opens with Alex at a crossroads in life without the job of her dreams, directionless and not serious about her future. After the death of her mother, Elizabeth (Connie Britton), Alex is shocked by the directives in her will. In a move that will remind Bollywood fans of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, her mother sends Alex her teenage bucket list to complete. Upon completion of each one, she receives a video message and moves one step closer towards her inheritance. Reluctantly, Alex agrees but not before arguing with everyone about it, including the handsome young lawyer Brad (Kyle Allen) assigned to handle her mother&rsquo;s estate.</p>

        <h2><a href="/reviews/mobland/">MobLand</a></h2>
        
        <p>The new crime drama, MobLand, directed by Guy Ritchie, holds all the hallmarks of the filmmaker. And yet there is something distinctive missing from the gritty gangster saga as Tom Hardy plays Harry Da Souza, a fixer left to clean up the many messes of the Harrigan family. So far, the nine-episode London-set series is keeping a cliffhanger for each chapter in trying to raise the tension. Ronan Bennett&rsquo;s series has had a slow-moving start, but it needs to amp things up to match the intensity of Ritchie&rsquo;s other projects. Hardy&rsquo;s Harry has been loyally serving Conrad Harrigan (Pierce Brosnan) for a long time now. The fixer saves the old crime lord and every member of his family whenever they get in a bind. But we join the story at a bit of a power struggle between the Harrigans and their rivals, the Stevensons, before erupting into an all out war. As Harry tries to smoothen things over, his family life suffers as well. Who will be left standing at the end when the lines are all drawn out against family loyalties?</p>

        <h2><a href="/reviews/the-studio-2/">The Studio</a></h2>
        
        <p>Making movies is a serious business. But in the Apple TV+ series, The Studio, co-created by Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Peter Huyck, Alex Gregory, and Frida Perez, seeing the behind-the-scenes decisions on how movies get sanctioned is very funny business indeed. Rogen is Matt Remick, who is bumped up as the head of Continental Studios, and has to prove himself over and over as he tries to do what he loves the most, make movies. The clever and biting satire lifts the lid on awards ceremonies, industry parties, and of course, the deals that go into making sure the movies get sanctioned in the first place. Corporate CEO Griffin Mill, played by the excellent Bryan Cranston in a guest appearance, promotes Matt Remick as top boss and sets some unreasonable expectations on him. The movie-loving executive has some tough decisions to make from here on, most of which he fumbles badly. Like most studios, Matt must launch a franchise based on a nostalgic brand like Barbie, and watching him and his team put together a film on Kool-Aid is downright hilarious. Even more cringeworthy are Matt&rsquo;s interactions with people who make movies; he has a desperate need to be liked. At times when absolutely everything goes wrong, he and his team manage to hold it through.</p>

        <p>A standalone followup to Khakee: The Bihar Chapter, this new instalment is set in Kolkata, with the only similarity being a cop bringing down a crime nexus. In Khakee: The Bengal Chapter, the corruption is deep-rooted, wherein the politicians in power already have an alliance with gangsters. The Hindi series, created by Neeraj Pandej, boasts of a star-studded cast who fill out the erractic narrative in which every man and woman is out for themselves. The crime thriller is set in the early 2000s, with Parambrata Chatterjee playing an honorable cop who sets out to break up the lawlessness in the city. However, his death sets off a chain of events that leads to the downfall of the whole criminal alliance between the ruling party, the cops, and the top crime lord Bagha (Saswata Chatterjee). Afterwards, the balance of power continues to shift as everyone tries to make a play. But with a new man on the scene with IPS Arjun Maitra (Jeet), it starts off a bloody game of chess.</p>

        <p>There have several documentaries and series dissecting the curious case of Natalia Grace, a young Ukrainian girl with dwarfism adopted by an American couple. Later, the couple, Kristen and Michael Barnett, allege that they&rsquo;ve been misled and Natalia is actually an adult. The adoption drama, which later escalates into a legal trial, is detailed in the new JioHotstar series, Good American Family, led by Ellen Pompeo and Mark Duplass. The tone of the series feels similar to a horror film or a car crash, when you know that the inevitable is upon you soon. Kristen (Ellen Pompeo) and Michael Barnett (Mark Duplass) already have a strained marriage, raising three boys, including one with autism. They are seeking to adopt a young girl to complete their family. Kristen is shown as a selfless Midwestern mother, running a rec center for special needs and raising her autistic son, who is considered a prodigy. Meanwhile, Michael is shown as slightly more needy and unable to handle the larger pressures of life. Their marriage is one crack away from splitting when Natalia Grace (Imogen Faith Reid) enters their home.</p>

        <p>Remo D&rsquo;Souza&rsquo;s latest dance film Be Happy revolves around the relationship between a straitlaced single father and his imaginative daughter. Together, through the medium of dance, they learn to live life to its fullest. While much of the Hindi film is focused on young Dhara wanting to achieve her dream of appearing on the dance reality show India&rsquo;s Superstar Dancer, Be Happy is much stronger when it rests on the father-daughter bond. The dance portions of the film are unnecessarily stretched. Dhara (Inayat Varma) lives with her father Shiv Rastogi (Abhishek Bachchan) and grandfather Mr Nandar (Nasser) in Ooty. But her real dream is to join Maggie Teacher&rsquo;s (Nora Fatehi) top dance academy in Mumbai and appear on India&rsquo;s Superstar Dancer. The musical drama follows how she manages to fulfill her wishes against all odds. Along the way, Shiv also learns to be a little less rigid and protective as a single father after the death of his wife Rohin (Harleen Sethi).</p>

        <p>Co-created by star Stephen Graham and filmmaker Jack Thorne, Adolescence should become necessary viewing at schools for teachers, students, and parents. The four-part series is focused on the arrest of a 13-year-old boy, Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper), accused of stabbing his classmate fatally. The British series deftly captures how this incident affects all those around Jamie—his family, the police, his classmates, and even the psychologist assigned to the case. While the devastating story will leave you emotionally sapped at the end, Adolescence is a stark reminder of the evolving world around us where kids are forced to grow up much too fast.</p>

        <p>The eight-episode series Dope Thief takes its main characters on an absolute journey as greed and corruption in law enforcement are exposed through each stage. Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura&rsquo;s characters are longtime friends who are drawn into this mess and try to emerge on the other side unscathed. The story hooks you in from the start, but with each twist, you&rsquo;ll find yourself rolling your eyes at the outrageous turn of events. The well-acted crime drama is worth tuning in only for its cast. Ray (Brian Tyree Henry) and Manny (Wagner Moura) became the best of friends in juvenile detention and continued their life of crime undetected as adults. The duo pose as DEA agents and rob small drug dealers of their stash and money. Until one day when they hit the wrong meth house in the middle of nowhere. Suddenly, they are entangled in the larger narcotic crime ring that involves more dangerous drug dealers and even the cops themselves. With no one to turn to and their families now in danger, how do the two friends find an escape?</p>

        <p>The 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre remains a pivotal event in India&rsquo;s fight for freedom. The deadly killings of hundreds of Indian civilians during the British Raj have been covered several times in cinema. SonyLIV&rsquo;s new limited series looks at the painful historical event through the eyes of a young lawyer who is part of the Hunter Commission, which aims to find out what happened that day in April 1919. Led by a very able Taaruk Raina as the London return lawyer, The Waking of a Nation is less a historical recreation of what happened but rather an examination of the events that led up the massacre.</p>

        <p>Picture This, led by Simone Ashley, is a remake of the Australian rom-com Five Blind Dates from star Shuang Hu. Relocated to London, director Prarthana Mohan&rsquo;s film takes the same elements but places it within a dysfunctional but loving British Asian family. Amidst wedding planning, blind dating, and reconnecting with an old love, Ashley&rsquo;s Pia finds herself again in this funny and enjoyable romantic comedy. The Amazon Prime Video feature is fast-paced and colourful, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. Ashley is Pia Jaswani, a talented photographer who owns her own photography studio, The Ninth Mandala, and runs it with her best friend Jay (Luke Fetherston). Her younger sister Sonal (Anoushka Chadha) announces she&rsquo;s getting married with a month-long series of events. Their mother Laxmi (Sindhu Vee) calls an astrologer (Kulwinder Dhir) to check the groom and bride&rsquo;s janampatris (birthcharts), when he suddenly predicts Pia will meet her soulmate after going on five dates. Her meddling family gets to work with unsuitable suitors, while her first love Charlie (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) walks back in her life.</p>

        <p>The first Daredevil series was launched nearly a decade ago on Netflix and lasted for three seasons. Much has changed in the Daredevil universe, and we&rsquo;ve seen Matt Murdock, aka Daredevil, pop up in the MCU to interact with other characters. However, it is great to see him back in his own show, Daredevil: Born Again, tackling new cases and standing up to Kingpin, aka Wilson Fisk, again. The actors who play these characters step right back into it as the nine-episode series sets up a new collision course for Daredevil and Kingpin. The relative peace of the law firm Nelson Page and Murdock is shattered by a tragic event in the premiere, which spurs Matt (Charlie Cox) to retire his Daredevil persona for a bit. Meanwhile, Wilson Fisk (Vincent D&rsquo;Onofrio) returns after an assassination attempt with a renewed sense of responsibility and decides to run for mayor of New York City. A more sober Matt is focused on his law firm, while Fisk wants to be the people&rsquo;s politician who wants to rid the city of all its vigilantes. The former rivals have their radars set on high again as events keep pulling them back in each other&rsquo;s orbit.</p>

        <p>Dabba Cartel is an intriguing mix of a desi drug syndicate gone bad and suburban drama, with an added dose of the murky world of pharma industries. But most of all, this crime drama is the story of individuals pushed to the limit even when their intentions are well-meaning. Created by Shibani Akhtar, Vishnu Menon, Gaurav Kapur, and Akanksha Seda, the Netflix series has an impressive cast that does justice to different riveting plotlines that converge at one thrilling juncture. Taking place in the nondescript VivaLife Society in Thane, the so-called drug business starts off small and clandestine until it snowballs into something that has deadly consequences for all involved. There&rsquo;s another layer of a pharma company covering up their involvement in the distribution of a lethal painkiller. Woven into this are the stories of men and women aiming for a better life, from a couple hoping to migrate to Germany to a maid wanting her young daughter to have nicer things. However, greed and ambition catch up with them, leaving them at a crossroads.</p>

        <p>Toxic Town is the true story about an English steel town&rsquo;s toxic waste that led to birth defects amongst the children. But more than that, the series is about the legal fight to get acknowledgement and justice for the pain and suffering they&rsquo;ve been through. While the four-part series takes place over many years and tracks the arduous legal battle, Toxic Town is noteworthy for the stellar performances from its British cast led by Doctor Who and Broadchurch&rsquo;s Jodie Whittaker. The limited series revolves around the working-class town of Corby, where the closing of a steel mill leads to other construction opportunities. However, as the site is developed into something different by negligent crews, under the lax leadership of the city council, the toxins seep into the town, affecting future generations. Mothers Susan (Jodie Whitaker), Tracey (Aimee Lou Wood), and Maggie (Claudia Jessie) all suffer different kinds of trauma as they watch their children suffer and, in Tracey&rsquo;s case, watch them die. It takes much time, nearly 15 years, before any kind of resolution is reached.</p>

        <p>Nickel Boys, directed by RaMell Ross, is up for two Oscar awards at the upcoming ceremony on March 2. It deserved a few more nominations, including one for its cinematography that details the alternating perspectives of its teenage lead characters, Elwood and Turner. This tragic story, adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Colson Whitehead, hits even harder in this visual format, backed by some exceptional performances. Set in 1960s Florida, the story sees change coming to the US in the form of the civil rights movement and space travel, but in some places it feels like time never changed. Elwood Curtis (Ethan Herisse), a promising young Black teenager with a bright future, is caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. Transferred to the Nickel Academy, a reform school for juvenile delinquents, he learns how cruel the world can really be. Separated from his beloved grandmother (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor), he makes a friend in Turner (Brandon Wilson), who is desperate to escape from the clutches of the evil wardens.</p>

But we all know that the original Suits was a lighting in a bottle. This second spinoff from the same universe does not have the same charm as the original nor does it have the characters required to get invested. The spinoff introduces viewers to hot-shot LA lawyer Ted (Amell), who is on the verge of a big merger with his partner Stuart (Josh McDermitt). Amidst the chaos of all this lies the news that his father (Matt Letscher) is dying back in New York. The premiere episode revolves around our introduction of Ted&rsquo;s world, his fight to keep his firm and glimpses of his troubled past and shaky relationship with his father. A few generic supporting characters flit in and out.</p>

Even though White&rsquo;s narrative moves along glacially, there is enough to keep viewers intrigued. This year&rsquo;s guests include a trio of best friends, played by Leslie Bibb, Carrie Coon, and Michelle Monaghan; a rich white family led by actors Jason Isaacs and Parker Posey; and a mismatched couple, both in age and temperament, played by Walter Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood. The only familiar face for viewers is spa worker Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), who was present in the first season. With each day, White shows another facet of their complicated relationships with one another as well as their hopes for the future. But which one of these guests is the fallen victim? Mike White is once again the creative force behind this season, which focuses more on individual characters than on an overall arc. The Western guests&rsquo; storylines have more prominence this time. However, the narratives for the Thai staff, security guard Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong) and hotel worker Mook (Blackpink&rsquo;s Lisa), are promising. Lek Patravadi also stands out as resort owner Sritala. However, so far, without giving away too many spoilers, most of the characters are circling around one another, hiding away true motives. It&rsquo;s the same story structure as previous seasons, like some of the guests being resistant to wellness programs, just in a new aesthetic setting.</p>

        <p>We don&rsquo;t usually see love stories on film or OTT much these days, so our eyes were peeled for Rajshri Production&rsquo;s Bada Naam Karenge. The ambitious SonyLIV series unfolds like a feature film rather than a series. It&rsquo;s easy to get invested in the romance between Surbhi (Ayesha Kaduskar) and Rishabh (Ritik Ghanshani) in a story set in Madhya Pradesh. But once we get to the heart of the matter, Bada Naam Karenge becomes jumbled under the weight of so many characters and remains a bit dated. The romance features two families: the wealthy Rathis of Ratlam and the middle-class Guptas of Ujjain. A possible rishta is floated between Rishabh Rathi and Surbhi Gupta. As the families explore their union through an arranged marriage, the audience learns about a hidden secret between the two. Will Rishabh and Surbhi get together, or will the expectations of their families get in the way? The story and screenplay of Bada Naam Karenge has been penned by S Manasvi. Vidit Tripathi has also helped out with the screenplay and co-written the dialogues. Moving to the past and returning to the present, the initial batch of episodes holds promise as the young couple&rsquo;s story goes from enemies to lovers. Once the large cast of supporting players gets involved, it feels too behind the times. The main conflict between the two families also gets dragged out over the last few episodes, only to be quickly resolved over a big emotional scene.</p>

        <p>The series Apple Cider Vinegar wastes no time in telling viewers that it is a true story based on a lie. Set in Australia, the limited series is based on the wellness culture that emerged in the 2010s, with pretty young women leading the charge and telling people how to eat and shape their lives. Created by writer Samantha Strauss, the drama looks beyond pretty pictures and nice fonts on social media to look at the real story of what these women were going through. The limited series follows two women, Belle Gibson (Kaitlyn Dever) and Milla Blake (Alycia Debnam-Carey), both of whom had crafted an inspirational image as survivors who had overcome ill health. The only difference was that one woman was lying about her cancer diagnosis. Apple Cider Vinegar, which is set at the rise of blogging and social media, especially Instagram, is also a time capsule about wellness culture, which rejected science and heralded the benefits of nature. Based on the book The Woman Who Fooled the World by Beau Donelly and Nick Toscano, creator Strauss has written the series with Anya Beyersdorf and Angela Betzien. Apple Cider Vinegar goes pretty deep into the backstories of Belle and Milla and shows why, while their intentions were well-meaning at first, it all snowballed out by the end.</p>

        <h2><a href="/reviews/anuja-3/">Anuja</a></h2>
        
        <p>Written and directed by Adam J Graves, Anuja is one of five shorts nominated for an Oscar in the Best Live Action Short Film category. Backed by producers Guneet Monga, Mindy Kaling, and Priyanka Chopra, it gives viewers a glimpse into the lives of two young girls trying to survive in the city without much support. There is hope for the younger girl Anuja, and the film highlights the hard choice the little one must face: choosing herself or supporting her beloved sister Palak. In just 22 minutes, the short film takes us on an emotional journey. The short film focuses on two orphaned sisters, Anuja (Sajda Pathan) and Palak (Ananya Shanbhag), who work in a garment factory in Delhi. Child labour is illegal, but the owner, Mr Verma (Nagesh Bhonsle), flaunts the rules by lying about the ages of the younger children. An educator, Mr Mishra (Gulshan Walia), comes to the factory with the opportunity of a lifetime for the bright Anuja. If she can take and pass an admission test for a boarding school, she&rsquo;ll receive a scholarship. But the fee for the test is Rs 400, which is a large sum for the sisters. Writer-director Graves straddles both the fictional and real worlds in this story. Made in conjunction with the Salaam Baalak Trust, which supports the street children of Delhi, Anuja turns a spotlight on the still-persistent issue of child labour. Poverty and a lack of education give rise to the problem that has been prevalent in India for decades. Still, Graves gives us a touching story about the unbreakable bond between the two sisters. The film begins with a fable about a farmer&rsquo;s family and a pet mongoose, highlighting the virtues of bravery and sacrifice.</p>

        <p>Noah Centineo returns as the bumbling but charming CIA lawyer Owen Hendricks in the new season of The Recruit. We left him in Season 1, kidnapped in the Czech Republic, and miraculously, Owen survives. Although he lands himself in an entirely new scrap that could have international implications. Alexi Hawley&rsquo;s series is two episodes shorter than the first, but the South Korea-set story remains entertaining in round two. Initially benched, Owen can&rsquo;t sit still and do nothing at the CIA, so he finds himself pulled into a new threat that takes him to Seoul, where he meets NIS agent Jang Kyun (Teo Yoo). Jang blackmails him to get something personal of his in return. Battling past demons with his late father&rsquo;s memory and his own time in Seoul as a child, Owen must use his quick-thinking skills to get what Jang wants. Additionally, Owen is also laying low against an internal investigation that could have him disbarred. Hawley makes good use of the baby-faced but earnest Noah as the protagonist Owen in The Recruit. This season, with new and old characters, the series has a good mix of the pending storyline and a new mystery to take the story further. The show continues to lean into the lawyer jokes, and there were several scenes that made me laugh out loud more than once.</p>

        <p>Created by Charlie Day, Megan Ganz, and Rob McElhenney, Mythic Quest returns after a long gap. Its last season premiered in November 2022. But for all intents and purposes, the show has never wavered. The executives and creatives working at Mythic Quest Studios have their own quests to overcome this season. Creatives Ian Grimm (Rob McElhenney) and Poppy Li (Charlotte Nicdao) work on an expansion to their game that just might drive them apart, while the rest of the gang faces some professional setbacks as well. Studio boss David Brittlesbee (David Hornsby) tries to push the company towards more profits, while the creative gang of Ian, Poppy, and Dana (Imani Hakim) face a breaking point of their own in their careers. This fourth season explores the dynamics of the employee versus company, with each side facing some wins and losses. Creative and personal partnerships also go through a change as Poppy and Ian find themselves unable to work with each other and girlfriends Dana and Rachel (Ashly Burch) learn boundaries. The best thing about Mythic Quest is the actors are also creatively involved behind the scenes, which adds to the collaborative effect of the series. Hornsby and Burch have worked on the scripts, while Nicdao, Hakim, Danny Pudi, and Burch again have sat in the director&rsquo;s chair this season. The fourth episode directed by creator Ganz is the standout as it cleverly employs each character in a murder mystery party scenario while moving the story forward. Another plotline where Ian and Poppy use AI models of themselves to argue with one another was hilarious.</p>

But like Fogelman&rsquo;s previous works, the narrative is more layered than it seems. Paradise mixes a few genres to give viewers a thriller with an intriguing twist. Xavier Collins (Brown) is one of President Cal Bradford&rsquo;s (James Marsden) lead agents. So when the unthinkable occurs, the level-headed man approaches with a clear focus as someone who would always do the right thing. Amidst high-level government officials and a few billionaires lies a conspiracy that continues to astonish the deeper we fall into it. The eight-episode series has a massive reveal at the end of the first episode, forcing viewers to rethink everything about what has been shown to them so far. That is usually the modus operandi of Fogelman and his usual collaborators, directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. In Paradise, the show slowly unveils each character and scenario in a leisurely manner.</p>

The Apple TV+ series Severance is a fascinating thriller set in the corporate world that might just be one of the most intriguing streaming series right now. Exploring the premise of having an &lsquo;inner&rsquo; and &lsquo;outer&rsquo; self at work and home, the show created by Dan Erickson returns for a second season that continues to examine what it means to be human in a world that is out to exploit you constantly. The second season picks up after the uprising from the innies at the Macrodata Refinement team at Lumon Industries, where Mark (Adam Scott), Helly R (Britt Lower), and Irving (John Turturro) are able to explore the outside world. Management is not happy as the gang is put through their paces initially and pushed even further as they come to terms with the added knowledge of their outie selves. Audiences get to explore more of the Lumon offices with new expanded departments and co-workers like Miss Huang (Sarah Bock), the new deputy manager who is just a child.</p>

Gabriel Basso plays the earnest young government official Peter Sutherland, an FBI agent in this case, who accidentally uncovers a conspiracy to kill the president. The action drama mixed all the right ingredients, and now as it returns for Season 2, it continues where it left off, and adds more urgency. The new season takes place 10 months after the first season, with Peter on assignment as a Night Action agent. Within the first 15 minutes, there&rsquo;s immediate danger, putting him in the same position as he was in Season 1, not knowing who to trust. However, the smart-thinking agent follows his own leads to find out who amongst the agency is leaking information on the outside. He is reunited with his former girlfriend Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan), who proves to be a great asset to him, even as another plotline on the side involves suspicious goings on at the Iranian mission to the United Nations.</p>

        <p>Co-created by Vikramaditya Motwane and Satyanshu Singh, the Netflix series Black Warrant is adapted from Sunil Gupta and Sunetra Choudhury&rsquo;s non-fiction. Set in the 1980s, it follows a young man who signs up to be a jailer in Delhi&rsquo;s Tihar Jail, as it is the only job available, and finds himself in the process. With compelling performances and an engrossing narrative, the prison drama unfolds just like a page-turner you can&rsquo;t put down. At the end of the seven episodes, Black Warrant will leave you wanting more. Zahan Kapoor plays the straitlaced Sunil Gupta, who moulds himself and his beliefs according to the job. His co-workers, played by Paramvir Cheema and Anurag Thakur, seem better suited for the position. His boss, Rajesh Tomar (Rahul Bhat), and family don&rsquo;t think he can last long. But he proves them all wrong as he keeps at it, despite facing the wrath of his superiors every other episode. Sunil must prove himself over and over again. With Sunil&rsquo;s growth, audiences learn the stories of the prisoners, from the most notorious murderers to the petty criminals. Some of these are taken from the famous inmates who were housed at Tihar, some awaiting execution.</p>

The new series is situated in Long Beach, California, where a seasoned police officer trains a newbie after one of her former trainees is murdered on the job. Starring Troian Bellisario and Brandon Larracuente in the leads, Amazon Prime Video&rsquo;s On Call flies right out of the gate but circles around the same few issues over and over again. Troian Bellisario is by-the-books officer Traci Harmon, who never fired a weapon in 12 years. Meanwhile, Alex Diaz is an overeager rookie who wants to do it again. Following the death of officer Delgado (Monica Raymund) for a routine traffic stop, the Long Beach police force is on the hunt for a cop killer. However, it is Harmon who takes the search to heart while maintaining the on-the-job lessons for the new guy on the beat.</p>

And this follow-up does not disappoint, largely due to the reappearance of the greatest villain in the franchise, Feather McGraw. Yes, that dastardly silent penguin is back, and he wants revenge on the duo that sent him to jail all those years ago. Will he succeed? Not if Gromit has his way. With Nick Park back as co-director, Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl is a funny, delightful romp in the neighbourhood. Wallace&rsquo;s newest invention in the film is a Norbot, a smart gnome robot ready to help poor Gromit around the house. Even when he doesn&rsquo;t need any help. What the pair don&rsquo;t realise that someone&rsquo;s got their eye on them, all the way from jail, as the quick-witted penguin has been biding his time, waiting to get back at Wallace for turning him into the authorities in the 1993 short film The Wrong Trousers for attempting to steal the Blue Diamond. Soon, Wallace and his trusty dog Gromit are evading the police, who believe he might be the recent spate of neighbourhood robberies.</p>

Strangely, there is a connection to the missing woman she is currently investigating. Meanwhile, there is also the matter of Kat&rsquo;s dad, a police officer who is murdered by a hitman.

        <p>After its premiere in 2021, it was easy to see why Squid Game became the most popular show in the world. Writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk&rsquo;s universal story of greed and betrayal, which exposed humanity&rsquo;s basest behaviour, struck a chord globally. Audiences took to the characters created in this universe and mourned as we lost several fan favourites who were treated as pawns in the deadly contest based on nostalgic children&rsquo;s games. The show returns after three years and a time jump, as the last winner Seong Gi-hun decides to infiltrate the games to take it down. Lee Jung-jae&rsquo;s Gi-hun is a much-changed man this season as he&rsquo;s on a mission to dismantle the games. Plagued with guilt about his survival after his friends didn&rsquo;t make it, he wants to save others from succumbing to the same fate. But his plan faces plenty of hurdles that he doesn&rsquo;t anticipate. The Front Man (Lee Byung-hun), the overseer of the game, has a bigger role than last season, and police officer Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-joon) also returns to find his way back to find out more about the mysterious organisation that runs the games.</p>

        <p>The Fifteenth Doctor, played by Ncuti Gatwa, has settled in nicely as the latest Time Lord. The Sex Education star took over the role from David Tennant this time last year. This year, for his second Doctor Who Christmas Special, the actor embarks on a new phase as he leaves behind his old companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson). In the time in between, he saves humanity once more, with a little help from Bridgerton&rsquo;s Nicola Coughlan. The story of this Christmas special titled Joy to the World moves around to different eras, past, present, and future. All of this becomes important to the narrative, which hinges upon the holiday of Christmas and a Villengard briefcase with a seed star, which is a ticking bomb in itself. A young woman named Joy (Coughlan) checks into a Sandringham hotel, and she ends up being key to the Doctor&rsquo;s latest mission to save the world during the holidays. But how do they manage to save humanity from destruction? By using every loophole when it comes to time.
Doctor Who Christmas Special: Writing and Direction Former showrunner and Sherlock writer Steven Moffat pens this new Christmas special. The opportunity allows us to see a slightly different side of Gatwa&rsquo;s Doctor as he goes gung-ho on a mission that seems doomed to fail. The holiday episode also grows sentimental, as Joy has an emotional outburst, explaining how she lost her mother during the COVID crisis in 2020.</p>

Honouring both the comics and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it allowed the story to be taken further. Once more, Jeffrey Wright returns as the voice of The Watcher as he narrates these eight new stories from the multiverse, where characters from different worlds and times converge. While previous seasons were strong, this last season is a mixed bag. It starts off muddled and ends on a high note, leaving us wishing this season had a bit more substance. Each of the eight episodes of What If&hellip;? looks at an alternative universe where characters who wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily meet are featured. And of course, the casual fan or newbie will be extremely lost, as the series requires you to do your homework (watch all the stuff) before enjoying this even more. Some of the stories explored here include the Hulk accidentally creating a gamma monster that the Mech Avengers must battle with, Agatha Harkness going Hollywood and meeting up with Bollywood star King, the Watcher disappearing, and the most bizarre of all, Howard the Duck having a baby with Darcy Lewis!</p>

However, for a younger audience, the craziness of the narrative might be just passable.</p>

        <p>Neeraj Pandey’s Sikandar Ka Muqaddar is a face-off between two stubborn men played by Jimmy Shergill and Avinash Tiwary, both of whom believe they are in the right. The Hindi feature goes back and forth between their perspectives, and as the story goes from 2008 to 2003 after a diamond heist remains unsolved. The writer-director tries to get us emotionally invested in this twisty tale of wills, but the nearly two-and-a-half-hour film drags out its premise.</p>

The shocking story is told by actress Anna Kendrick in her promising directorial debut that is sure to leave an impact.</p>
<p>The film is set in 1977-1978, following the serial killer Rodney Alcala (Daniel Zovatto), who stalked and murdered women on the pretext of photographing them all over the US. When he lands on a dating show, Rodney ends up being the only bachelor on the panel of three that aspiring actress Sheryl Bradshaw (Kendrick) unfortunately connects with. Woman of the Hour unnervingly shows how few people picked up on Rodney&rsquo;s creepy vibe and suspected something was amiss. And how it took a while before &lsquo;The Dating Game Killer&rsquo; was eventually brought to justice.</p>
