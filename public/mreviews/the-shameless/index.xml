      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Shameless became highly recognizable after its Cannes 2024 victory. The film&amp;rsquo;s leading star Anasuya Sengupta made history and became the first Indian actor to win the Best Actress Award at Cannes. The film explores the story of two polar women stuck in the world of prostitution finding hope in each other, but the bleakness and grim reality of the world is always just around the corner to take it away. The film though dramatic and dark has much appreciative theatrical performances with wit of Sengupta&amp;rsquo;s abrasive character. Devi and Renuka keep the story balanced but the outcome is left for the audience to endure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
