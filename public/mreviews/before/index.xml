      <description>&lt;p&gt;Billy Crystal is known for his roles that show off his comedic range like Harry Met Sally&amp;hellip; and City Slickers. With his latest project, Before, the veteran actor is trying out a different side to his talent. He plays a grieving widower who finds purpose treating a young boy named Noah with unprocessed trauma. Written by creator Sarah Thorp, the psychological thriller delves into coincidences, fate and things science can&amp;rsquo;t explain. The Apple TV+ has a shaky narrative that gets repetitive fast and leaves its big reveal too late.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
