      <description>&lt;p&gt;Created by Charlie Day, Megan Ganz, and Rob McElhenney, Mythic Quest returns after a long gap. Its last season premiered in November 2022. But for all intents and purposes, the show has never wavered. The executives and creatives working at Mythic Quest Studios have their own quests to overcome this season. Creatives Ian Grimm (Rob McElhenney) and Poppy Li (Charlotte Nicdao) work on an expansion to their game that just might drive them apart, while the rest of the gang faces some professional setbacks as well. Studio boss David Brittlesbee (David Hornsby) tries to push the company towards more profits, while the creative gang of Ian, Poppy, and Dana (Imani Hakim) face a breaking point of their own in their careers. This fourth season explores the dynamics of the employee versus company, with each side facing some wins and losses. Creative and personal partnerships also go through a change as Poppy and Ian find themselves unable to work with each other and girlfriends Dana and Rachel (Ashly Burch) learn boundaries. The best thing about Mythic Quest is the actors are also creatively involved behind the scenes, which adds to the collaborative effect of the series. Hornsby and Burch have worked on the scripts, while Nicdao, Hakim, Danny Pudi, and Burch again have sat in the director&amp;rsquo;s chair this season. The fourth episode directed by creator Ganz is the standout as it cleverly employs each character in a murder mystery party scenario while moving the story forward. Another plotline where Ian and Poppy use AI models of themselves to argue with one another was hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
