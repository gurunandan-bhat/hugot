      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cinema as a medium commands and deserves respect, both from its audience and those who work in it, especially directors and actors. So, how does one review a film where the hero and director are the same person, and when both work in tandem to leave you with a confused set of images that lead nowhere. What if they rest on past glories, justified or not, and leave you with problematic imagery and dialogues that leave your head spinning, and make you so want to say, ‘&lt;em&gt;Boss, idhu 2024. 1980s alla&lt;/em&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
