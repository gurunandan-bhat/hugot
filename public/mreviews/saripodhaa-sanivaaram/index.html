        <p>Watching a neatly woven commercial cinema is therapeutic in every sense. And when it is headlined by powerhouse performers, Nani and SJ Suryah, you know you&rsquo;re in for a treat. &lsquo;Saripodhaa Sanivaaram&rsquo; marks Nani and director Vivek Athreya&rsquo;s second collaboration after &lsquo;Ante Sundaraniki&rsquo;. While &lsquo;Ante Sundariniki&rsquo; was a cute rom-com, Nani and Vivek went all out for &lsquo;Saripodhaa Sanivaaram&rsquo; by picking a masala entertainer with a family backdrop. Surya (Nani) is a loved elder child to his parents (Abhirami and Sai Kumar). But, his anger is his problem. His mother, who is counting her days, teaches him a unique way to keep his anger in check and let it out only on Saturdays. Surya makes note of people who wronged him on the rest of the days and gets time to process his anger till Saturday. And when he feels his anger is justified, he thrashes the people who angered him.</p>
