      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inside Out 2 returned this year to theatres with great fanfare as the sequel took audiences back to Riley&amp;rsquo;s life as she begins high school. The new animated series, Dream Productions, is set slightly before the film and follows Riley as a pre-teen adjusting to the time in-between being a kid and a teenager. Instead of the core gang of emotions that we are used to, the miniseries focuses on bubbly dream director, Paula Persimmon, who finds herself being obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
