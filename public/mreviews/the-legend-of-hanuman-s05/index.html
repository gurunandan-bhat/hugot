        <p>With Indrajith no longer around and Ravan drowning in sadness, Ahiravan wreaks havoc on the Lankan dynasty. Hanuman is surprised to realise he has a son – Makardhwaja, who opposes him initially but makes amends later. He also finds unexpected support from Ravan’s former aide Harshasringa in his quest to free Ram and Laxman from Ahiravan. Who has the last laugh?</p>
<p>Ramayana has been retold in several formats across multiple dimensions over the years but Disney+ Hotstar’s The Legend of Hanuman has stood tall for its effort to preserve the sanctity of the epic, reimagine it in an innovative visual form, appealing to kids and adults at once. Created by Sharad Devarajan, Jeevan J Kang and Charuvi Agarwal, the show, in its fifth season, yet again captures the essence of Hanuman’s colourful, nuanced persona effectively.</p>
