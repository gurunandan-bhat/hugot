      <description>&lt;p&gt;A portly white-haired man walks into the frame and, even before he’s sat, addresses the camera with some urgency. “Before he arrives, there are some things I just want to say. It’s about the nature of the structure of, and the destructure, and the non-structure of what we see.&amp;quot; He lists the disparate thoughts running through his head: a green cake he once ate in Naples, the fish pie he must take out of the freezer, a line from Mayakovsky, digging in &lt;em&gt;The Great Escape&lt;/em&gt; and as a young boy on the beach, a row of coffins for mass burial, the impending birth of his granddaughter&lt;/p&gt;</description>
