      <description>&lt;p&gt;Young Woman and the Sea is a typical sports drama, like the ones that were made often in Hollywood two to three decades ago. The period drama, directed by Joachim Rønning, follows the real-life story of Trudy Ederle, a young American who set some extraordinary records and inspired a whole generation of women after her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Daisy Ridley, best known for her role in the newer Star Wars trilogy, takes on the physical role of the plucky swimmer who always wanted to push herself. With a compelling supporting cast, director Rønning and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson bring alive the tale of a forgotten woman in sporting history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
