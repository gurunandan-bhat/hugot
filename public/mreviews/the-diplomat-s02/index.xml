      <description>&lt;p&gt;The second season of The Diplomat returns with more urgency as the US ambassador to UK, Kate Wyler, tries to uncover who is behind two terrorists attacks on British targets. The political drama is led by the excellent Keri Russell who navigates the exciting twists and turns along with the audience. Debora Cahn&amp;rsquo;s The Diplomat gives viewers a front seat to an unfolding international crisis, where the stakes have never been higher.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
