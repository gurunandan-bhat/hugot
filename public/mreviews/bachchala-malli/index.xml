      <description>&lt;p&gt;In times of chest-thumping heroism when films are relentlessly packed with a series of highs, it is heartening that filmmaker Subbu Mangadevi has chosen to tell the story of a loser rather unapologetically. His Bachchala Malli is about a good-for-nothing youngster Malli (Allari Naresh) who treads a self-destructive path while never recovering from his setbacks. Malli is, by no means, your average male protagonist. He barely acknowledges his motherâ€™s presence at the house, stitches gunny bags for a living, steals donation boxes from children for a drink at a local bar, engaging in petty fights with fellow customers. As he falls off his bike, lying unconscious on the road, not a soul cares for him, after which you are gradually introduced to his not-so-rosy past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
