      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mother&amp;rsquo;s Instinct could have been named &amp;lsquo;Mom gone bonkers&amp;rsquo;. Turning the concept/ idea/ theme of a mother&amp;rsquo;s selfless love for her child on its head, this 2024 thriller, now streaming on Prime Video, is a pulpy watch, with maternal instinct going into a zone dark enough to result in murder. A couple of them, in fact. Set in the 1960s and headlined by Hollywood A-listers Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain, the directorial debut of acclaimed French cinematographer Benoit Delhomme has a Hitchcockian feel of unease and foreshadowing, but never really lives up to its ultimately pulpy potential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
