      <description>&lt;p&gt;HBO has wrapped for the first season of Dune Prophecy which also starred our very own Tabu in the role of a Sister working with The Sisterhood aka Bene Gesserit, widely known in the Dune Universe. The show takes place 10,000 years before the current films directed by Denis Villeneuve. But the prequel is still connected to the current storyline as it explores the lore of how the Bene Gesserit prophecy about Paul Atreides came into being. The show begins with the story of two Harkonnen sisters who have been accepted into the sisterhood. One of them, Valya Harkonnen had special powers which let me control the will of others on her command, she goes on to teach the same to others in the sisters who followed the same values as her. Meanwhile, another has her own secrets to protect. The sisterhood also has factions, while one believes in nurturing the good in humans and use the power of truth sense to lead humanity towards a better future after the War with Thinking Machine which destroyed the world. The other faction believes, that humans need a genetically enhanced leader to take them to the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The prequel series, Dune: Prophecy, opens with an interesting quote that lays the foundation for its narrative ahead. It states, &amp;ldquo;Victory is celebrated in the light, but won in the darkness.&amp;rdquo; The HBO show is set around 10,000 years before the existence of Timothee Chalamet&amp;rsquo;s Paul Atreides from Dune; a powerful organisation called the Sisterhood aims to guide humanity to its correct path. Easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All &amp;ldquo;thinking machines&amp;rdquo; are banned in this world after a harrowing war that nearly exterminated humans. The Sisterhood, led by the Harkonnnen sisters Valya (Emily Watson) and Tula (Olivia Williams), who have different approaches to their ultimate goalâ€”to make sure one of their own sits on the throne to the Imperium. Princess Ynez (Sarah-Sofie Boussnina) is about to join the Sisterhood as an acolyte before she takes the throne. Besides the mysterious Sisterhood, there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of palace intrigue as a newcomer, Desmond Hart (Travis Fimmel), gains the confidence of Emperor Javicco Corrino (Mark Strong).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
