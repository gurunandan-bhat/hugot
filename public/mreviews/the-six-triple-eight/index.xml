      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prolific filmmaker Tyler Perry&amp;rsquo;s latest is a departure from his usual fare. The actor-director tells the story of the inspiring women of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, the only all-Black unit of the Women&amp;rsquo;s Army Corps that served in Europe. It is a tale not many were aware of, and the movie highlights how the women endured and served with dedication despite the odds against them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
