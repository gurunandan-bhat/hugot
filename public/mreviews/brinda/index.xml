      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;South Queen&amp;rsquo; Trisha Krishnan forayed into OTT with the Telugu web series, &amp;lsquo;Brinda&amp;rsquo;, directed by Surya Manoj Vangala. While the web series started premiering on SonyLIV on August 2, there have been low-key promotions for whatever reason. At a time when there are many web series on multiple platforms, &amp;lsquo;Brinda&amp;rsquo; stands apart. This is truly one of the web shows that deserves more promotion. Brinda (Trisha Krishnan) is a newly appointed sub-inspector, who is moody and hardly gets treated as equals at the police station. She goes to work, struggles to sleep and is quite smart. When her superiors, including Sarathi (Ravindra Vijay), want to close a murder case as suicide, she smartly points out that it&amp;rsquo;s a murder. This smart work lands her in trouble as her boss always tries to put her in place because she&amp;rsquo;s a woman. But Brinda is someone who will not take it with a pinch of salt. She teaches him a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
