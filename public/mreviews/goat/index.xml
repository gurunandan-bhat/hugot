      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The Greatest of All Time&amp;rsquo; aka &amp;lsquo;GOAT&amp;rsquo; is Thalapathy Vijay&amp;rsquo;s penultimate film before he fully commits to politics. Tracing his career, one would truly understand why &amp;lsquo;GOAT&amp;rsquo; is probably the perfect title for Vijay. Director Venkat Prabhu&amp;rsquo;s spy thriller further establishes Thalapathy Vijay as truly &amp;rsquo;the greatest of all time&amp;rsquo;. Gandhi (Vijay), along with Sunil (Prashanth), Kalyan (Prabhudheva) and Ajay (Ajmal Ameer), forms the Special Anti-Terrorism Squad (SATS), led by Nasser (Jayaram). A fun and efficient team, they get the job done without much hassle. However, when Gandhi takes his pregnant wife (Sneha) and son Jeevan on a mission to Thailand, he faces a tragic loss, prompting him to seek a less risky job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
