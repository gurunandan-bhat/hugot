      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sir is one of those formulaic Tamil movies with a strong cause or message it wants to put across and doesnâ€™t mind doing so at the cost of being a didactic and dated. The style, writing, brevity, and everything that makes up for a superior form take a backseat in Sir as Bose Venkat prefers coming across as an activist to a fine filmmaker. While Sir has a noble cause at its core, the execution makes it a yarnfest, and instead of getting the catharsis such social commentary aims to provide, the film invokes a sense of guilt for feeling so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
