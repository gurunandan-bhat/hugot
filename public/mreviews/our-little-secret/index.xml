      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the second part of Lindsay Lohan&amp;rsquo;s acting comeback commenced with Irish Wish. The actress played a woman who is about to watch her best friend marry her longtime crush in Ireland. This time, Lohan is back with another romantic dilemma in Our Little Secret. Taking place at Christmas, Lohan&amp;rsquo;s character Avery meets her ex Logan (Ian Harding) at her new boyfriend&amp;rsquo;s house. Hilarity is supposed to ensue, but there&amp;rsquo;s very little to laugh about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
