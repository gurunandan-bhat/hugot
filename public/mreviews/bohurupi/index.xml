      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shiboprosad Mukherjee and Nandita Roy’s Bohurupi delivers what it promises: unadulterated entertainment. It is fun watching this mad cat-and-mouse game. The film is lavishly shot, and most importantly, made with care. It excels in almost every department with Shiboprosad’s skillful acting hogging the lion’s share of the limelight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To begin with, Bohurupi is based on a well-written script and made almost like a biopic of Bikram’s character. The comedy timing, the chemistry between the two lead pairs, the action sequences – everything seems to have worked suitably along with its script. There is no glaring social commentary and that has allowed the film to emerge as a champion masala entertainer. The second half gets into a bit of melodrama but recovers from it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
