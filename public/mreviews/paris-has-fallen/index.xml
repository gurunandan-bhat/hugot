      <description>&lt;p&gt;Paris Has Fallen is the first in the franchise that won&amp;rsquo;t feature Gerard Butler&amp;rsquo;s Secret Service agent Mike Banning. The actor will continue on with the character in the films; however, this spinoff series forges its own identity with new protagonists and a deadly plot in this European adventure. With only the first two episodes premiering so far, Paris Has Fallen has set up an interesting scenario in which the villain has had the upper hand; it remains to be seen how and when the &amp;lsquo;fall&amp;rsquo; will come.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
