      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the late 1970s, the king of Bhutan coined the term â€œgross national happiness&amp;quot;. GNH parameters are used to measure progress, well-being and happiness, placing their importance over economic pursuits alone. This programme has been pivotal in shaping development policies and governance in Bhutan, a landlocked nation in eastern Himalayas that is often ranked as one of the happiest in the world. Happiness surveyor Amber Kumar Gurung of the Happiness Centre is the subject of a new documentary, &lt;em&gt;Agent of Happiness&lt;/em&gt; (in competition at the MAMI Mumbai film festival 2024).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
