      <description>&lt;p&gt;Avee Sharma, a sexologist, is traumatised after breaking up with Shruti at the cusp of marriage. While he gradually comes to terms with it, he indulges in a no-strings-attached relationship with a patient â€“ a married woman Rekha. Later, he falls for a neighbour Nikita.
