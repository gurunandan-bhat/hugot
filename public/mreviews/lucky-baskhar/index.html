        <p>Lucky Baskhar, the Telugu film written and directed by Venky Atluri, employs the narrative technique of creating tense moments before a twist, then retracing a few steps to reveal the events that led to it, at sporadic intervals. The first time this happens, it is an indication of what the titular character is capable of. When this technique is repeated, there is the danger of it falling flat. There are occasions when we can pre-empt a twist, but the manner in which it unfolds brings a smile. This relationship drama woven around a financial scam is Atluri’s best work till date and is anchored by a powerhouse Dulquer Salmaan, who shifts seamlessly from a common man struggling to make ends meet to a shrewd banker driven by the need to make quick money.</p>

        <p>While promoting his latest movie, Lucky Baskhar, director Venky Atluri claimed that one of his biggest strengths is his talent in screenwriting. However, those closely following his filmography would tell you that his ability to assemble a stellar cast is his greatest asset. He once again showcases this strength with Lucky Baskhar.</p>
<p>Dulquer Salmaan is pitch-perfect as Baskhar Kumar, a working-class bank employee. In the late 80s, Baskhar, like millions of his countrymen, firmly believes that he could overcome his financial struggles by holding an honest, steady job. He is dedicated to his role as a cashier, showing up to work on time every day, the first to arrive and the last to leave. Known for his loyalty, respect for others, and charm, Baskhar embodies the ideal Indian man personality. He works hard for three years in hopes of earning a promotion that could alleviate his family’s middle-class challenges.</p>

        <p>Legendary American poet Maya Angelou once wrote, “When great trees fall in forests, small things recoil into silence…” Dulquer Salmaan’s latest film Lucky Baskhar is about one such small thing that decided to brave its fears, and find a way to survive when the tree of the great banking scam of the 90s fell. Of course, we have seen multiple iterations of this story through series like Scam 1992 and films like The Big Bull. But what Venky Atluri does in Lucky Baskhar is that he isn’t telling the story that everyone is focused on. He conjures up a story of a man who is caught in the crosshairs and decides to do something about it. Now, it is fictional, but it could have been true. And it is this thin line between fiction and reality that truly makes Lucky Baskhar a terrific watch.</p>

        <p>Fortune favours the brave – this is a slogan that aptly encapsulates what Lucky Baskhar is. Director Venky Atluri’s latest outing, far different from his previous offerings, is this year’s Diwali gift to the audience. Lucky Baskhar is a film about how a middle-class man, who aims for the sky, gets derailed due to greed, but is clever enough to pull him out of the mess. Sounds interesting, doesn’t it? Baskhar (Dulquer Salmaan) is a cashier in Magadha Bank. He is the sole breadwinner of his family, which consists of his wife Sumathi (Meenakshi Chaudhary), son Karthik (Rithvik), his ailing dad, brother and sister. They’re on the edge of poverty and debts strangle him. At that time, Anthony (Ramki), a man who wants a loan from Baskhar’s bank, comes up with an offer that he can’t refuse due to his familial circumstances.</p>
