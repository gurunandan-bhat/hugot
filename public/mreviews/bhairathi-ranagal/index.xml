      <description>&lt;p&gt;There can be no debate that the black dhoti and black shirt-wearing Shivarajkumar sitting on a wooden chair placed on an arid land is one of the more iconic images of recent Kannada cinema. It exuded silent power, and as always, the superstar knew that the greatest of style statements lies in its simplicity. The character of Bhairathi Ranagal from Mufti has since attained cult status for showcasing Shivarajkumar in a grounded yet gory avatar that beautifully balanced his stature, stardom, and age. So, when director Narthan, who made Mufti, decided to film a prequel to show the origin of Bhairathi Ranagal in the film titled Bhairathi Ranagal, one couldn’t help but be intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The trick with a prequel is that you have to impress viewers who have watched the original film, and those who are new to its cinematic world. So, first, a round of congratulations to director Narthan, who charmed in 2017 with his debut Mufti, and now with its prequel Bhairathi Ranagal, starring Shiva Rajkumar, Rahul Bose, Rukmini Vasanth and Chhaya Singh, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason Shiva Rajkumar or Shivanna, as he is more endearingly known, has the place he has in Kannada cinema. Many films tend to focus on his image to establish Shivanna’s character, forgetting what makes the 62-year-old Kannada star tick — a mix of reasonable brawn with loads of heart, one and off-screen. This is one of the reasons why the actor’s scenes in the Tamil film Jailer saw audiences clap and whistle even during repeat watches. After a long while, you see vintage Shiva Rajkumar on the big screen with this film, which not only allows him to wield weapons with finesse, but also gifts him some quiet moments on screen, a dignified middle-aged romance with Dr Vaishali (a very stately Rukmini Vasanth) without songs, and a fair bit of remorse too, when he occasionally remembers how far he’s travelled from where he began. It is Dr Vaishali who reminds him of the journey he’s had, and she decides to part ways. Again, credit to director Narthan for not making her the villain here, and allowing Ranagal a quick moment to ponder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shivarajkumar&amp;rsquo;s portrayal of Bhairathi Ranagal in the 2017 movie Mufti was a monumental success. His iconic look—featuring coloured khadi vestis and shirts—became a trendsetter, even inspiring Nandamuri Balakrishna&amp;rsquo;s style in Veera Simha Reddy. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that the filmmakers were tempted to delve deeper into the character and cater to the audience&amp;rsquo;s appetite for more. After all, the market rarely gets it wrong, right? Fast forward seven years and director Narthan brings us Bhairathi Ranagal, the origin story of this beloved character.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
