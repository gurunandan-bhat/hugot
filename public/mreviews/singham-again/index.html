        <p>There is an early scene in Singham Again where Ajay Devgn’s titular super-cop barges into his teenage son’s party along with a couple of cronies, embarrasses him in public, and hauls him back home. He does it, it seems, only to give director Rohit Shetty another opportunity to shoot him in stylised slow-motion. At home, Singham and his wife, Avni (Kareena Kapoor Khan) lecture their son about how out of touch he is with Indian values. It’s a deeply melodramatic moment; you can almost imagine them turning into Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini from Baghban in a couple of decades. But one thing is made absolutely clear by this early domestic drama: Shetty and Devgn don’t think too highly of the nation’s youth. This became a recurring theme even in their pre-release press interviews. They would both proudly declare that they barely resonate with the kids these days, and how, back in their day, they were roughing it out in the real world. This is a bizarre stance to take, for multiple reasons. For one, it’s always a good idea to understand younger generations. You might just learn something; just ask Javed Akhtar. But second, Singham Again is aimed at the very demographic that Shetty and Devgn have decided to infantilise.</p>

        <p>Rohit Shetty is probably the biggest showman in Bollywood right now. With Singham Again and the idea of a cop universe, he has pulled off the biggest mainstream casting in the last 25 years. With at least five top commercially viable actors—Ajay, Akshay, Ranveer, Deepika and Kareena—he has made the canvas of Singham Again so big that it is most likely to become the ‘go to’ movie of this year.</p>

        <p>Even before a gun is fired or a car destroyed in director Rohit Shetty’s latest cop-and-terrorist saga, a disclaimer is read out in two languages—about mentions of a Hindu god and respect for beliefs. When you consider that Singham Again is built on the bedrock of the epic, Ramayana—with Ajay Devgn’s Bajirao Singham likened to Lord Rama—, the disclaimer seems like a safe bet.</p>

        <p>Singham Again made quite the impression with its short film for a trailer. It also led to the perception that the film won&rsquo;t have much to offer after everything was revealed in the teasers and trailers. And yet the film surprises with its comedy and its Ramayan connective direction. Rohit Shetty does warn his audience and the religious critics that the film is not meant to disrespect anyone&rsquo;s faith or any religion with a two-minute long disclaimer and what follows is a cameo-filled film with a run time of 144 minutes.</p>

        <p>There was a time, not long ago, when Hindi blockbuster cinema could stand on its own — distinguishable, say, from mythological soap operas and tacky non-fiction programming on satellite TV. But the laziness and opportunism of the last few years have all but vaporized that distinction. It leaves the theatre-going audience in two minds. Adipurush (2023) was laughably inept yet insistently pious and grim. The same applies to Singham Again, ostensibly an action potboiler and an Avengers-like ‘team-up’ movie but playing like an ad for the tourism ministry’s Ramayana trail.</p>

        <p>2011 की ‘सिंहम’ तो ज़रूर याद होगी आपको। 2010 में आई इसी नाम की एक कामयाब तमिल फिल्म के इस रीमेक में स्टार के नाम पर कोई था तो सिर्फ अजय देवगन। लेकिन इसके साथ थी एक शानदार ढंग से कही गई कहानी जिसे निर्देशक रोहित शैट्टी ने अपने कसे हुए निर्देशन और ज़बर्दस्त एक्शन दृश्यों से ऐसा बना दिया था कि अब उस फिल्म की गिनती हिन्दी सिनेमा की कल्ट फिल्मों में होती है। लेकिन जैसा कि अपने यहां भेड़चाल है कि एक फिल्म हिट हो जाए तो उसका सीक्वेल ले आओ, सीक्वेल न बनता हो तो फ्रेंचाइज़ी ले आओ, ज़रूरत हो या न हो, उसमें ठूंस-ठूंस कर मसाले डाल दो, फिर अगल-बगल की फिल्मों के किरदार पकड़ लाओ और अपना खुद का एक ‘मसाला यूनिवर्स’ बना दो। रोहित शैट्टी तो वैसे भी इस काम में माहिर रहे हैं। एक तरफ ‘गोलमाल’ की कॉमेडी और दूसरी तरफ ‘सिंहम’, ‘सिंबा’, ‘सूर्यवंशी’ की मारधाड़ वाले दो यूनिवर्स खड़े कर चुके रोहित इस जन्म में कुछ नया न भी करें तो ये दोनों यूनिवर्स ही उन्हें और उनके कलाकारों को ब्रेड-बटर खिलाने के लिए काफी रहेंगे।</p>

        <p>Rohit Shetty’s cop universe has gone for the jugular this time. Following the lukewarm reception of Simmba (2018) and Sooryavanshi (2021), he has reintroduced his flagship character, Singham, while also incorporating other familiar figures in Singham Again.</p>

        <p>Can we let the epics be? Rohit Shetty&rsquo;s latest film Singham Again - a part of his elaborate cop universe essembles some of the biggest stars of Bollywood to narrate an unoriginal story and borrows the full plot from Hindu epic mythology Ramayan. But at a time when films like Adipurush and the anime Ramayan are already available in the digital space, how good an idea is it to again refurbish a known story and force-feed it through Shetty&rsquo;s larger-than-life, over-the-top cop universe? Questions such as this and a few more remain unanswered throughout the runtime of the film.</p>

        <p>They say that the fount of all Indian fiction are the two epics, Ramayan and Mahabharat. Rohit Shetty seems to have taken this old saying to heart because Ajay Devgn’s eponymous Bajirao Singham is none other than a latter-day Maryada Purushottam Ram, his wife Avni (Kareena Kapoor Khan) is the faithful Sita, and all the other characters play their parallels in this version of Kalyug-ke-Ram Ki Katha. The result is loud and tedious, and instantly forgettable.</p>

        <a href="/critics/ishita-sengupta/">Ishita Sengupta</a>
        <p>Of all the improbable things in Rohit Shetty’s Singham Again, like a car flying over a helicopter, like the same car landing without a scratch, like gifted actors dialling down their craft to match the trite script, like six people writing that script, like Ajay Devgn mistaking walking for acting, like the film mistaking walking for acting, the one that sticks out the most is Shetty assembling half the Hindi film industry (an exaggeration but you get the drift) to combat Arjun Kapoor.</p>

        <p>There is not a single subtle bone in Singham Again&rsquo;s action-packed, slo-mo loving body. While over-the-top has always been the signature of not only the Singham films but also of director Rohit Shetty&rsquo;s cinema as a whole, Singham Again takes it to level next. Which really isn&rsquo;t a good thing from the point of view of the art and craft of cinema but perhaps works in giving fans of this kind of filmmaking ample bang for their buck.</p>

        <p>Rohit Shetty’s cop sagas started with the brilliant Singham (2011). It was obvious for him to bring out a sequel to it. But Singham Returns (2014) turned out to be just an average fare. His latest and third outing in the series, Singham Again, is better than the 2014 film. Hence, it keeps alive his Cop Universe, which also contains the enjoyable Simmba (2018) and Sooryavanshi (2021).</p>
<p>In the pre-climax scene in Sooryvanshi, Bajirao Singham (Ajay Devgn) vows to finish off the terrorist Omar Hafiz (Jackie Shroff), who is hiding in Kashmir. As fate would have it, Singham soon gets posted in Kashmir and during the start of Singham Again, he captures Omar in an operation. Omar warns Singham that he will have to deal with a new evil force.</p>
