        <p>Prior to Win or Lose, Pixar Animation Studios&rsquo; series have all been spun off from their film franchise. With this new animated series, the studio is branching out into new territory, and it is a delight to see. The eight-episode series created by Carrie Hobson and Michael Yates is laugh out loud funny as it tackles every insecurity felt by various members of a middle school team. Interestingly, each episode is told from the viewpoint of a different character, adding to the mystery of who wins the final game. The first two episodes focus on different members of the Pickles softball team. The premiere episode tells the story from Coach Dan&rsquo;s (voice of Will Forte) daughter Laurie (voice of Rosie Foss). Insecure about her place in her dad&rsquo;s life, the child of divorce becomes so anxious she manifests her own &lsquo;sweaty&rsquo; devil. The second episode belongs teacher Frank (voice of Josh Thomson) who is also the umpire. Still hung up over his ex Monica (Vyvan Pham), he contemplates getting back into the dating scene.</p>
