      <description>&lt;p&gt;Comedies that mock America&amp;rsquo;s inexplicable obsession with true crime and especially podcasts are on the rise. The new season of Peacock&amp;rsquo;s Based on a True Story, starring Kaley Cuoco and Chris Messina, brings back their suburban couple, Ava and Nathan Bartlett, who thought unmasking a serial killer would make them famous. By the end of Season 2, the duo become more infamous thanks to their curiosity about a new copycat serial killer. The comedy is still funny and insightful even as it takes its time to surprise the characters and audience with new twists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
