      <description>&lt;p&gt;A taut and tense thriller, Crazxy, produced by and starring Sohum Shah, whose choices as an actor have never been conventional, upends genre norms to deliver a 93-minute adrenaline rush that until it ends up in a small puddle of avoidable mush is absolutely riveting fare. Coming to think of it, even the somewhat mawkish conclusion is not wholly out of place in a drama that blends the emotional with the visceral. Crazxy wastes nary a scene in its sustained bid to generate intrigue and suspense centred on the conversations and choices of the protagonist, a successful surgeon with a volatile past making his way through a day on which everything that can go wrong goes horribly wrong. The film rests on a virtuoso solo act that sees Sohum Shah in the guise of a Delhi doctor pulled into a heart-pounding race against time to save his kidnapped daughter, a girl he heartlessly abandoned due to no fault of hers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crazxy led by Sohum Shah follows after the actor&amp;rsquo;s biggest hit Tumbbad. While the new release is nothing close to the fantasy horror, it does bring a new and unique concept to the big screen. However, the promotional material from the film does not line up with the real concept nor does it bring the right expectations from the film. The misdirection adds to the mystery but doesn&amp;rsquo;t last long as the plot turns predictable early one. The film&amp;rsquo;s climax also leaves much to be desired despite the concept. The film begins with Sohum Shah getting ready with a massive bag on his way to the hospital, getting bombarded with calls about reaching on time. Early on, the makers establish that Sohum&amp;rsquo;s character Abhimanyu isn&amp;rsquo;t the good guy. He is set up at the obnoxious ex-husband, a terrible father and a doctor who does not care much for the patients. He is about to settle a big case, and pay for his life with the 5 crore in his car, and move on with his new girlfriend. However, one phone call changes it all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We get so many spam calls these days that it is hard to figure out which ones are real. Then, while driving the car, you listen to FM stations where prank calls drive the programming. Director Girish Kohli employs this odd everyday reality in this thrilling race against time. On the way to the hospital to settle a crucial deal, doctor Abhimanyu (Sohum Shah) gets a mysterious call telling him that his daughter has been kidnapped, and he has time till sunset to save her life. As Abhimanyu presses the pedal, Kohli drops red herrings on the highway. Gradually, we discover that Abhimanyu is an inadequate surgeon and a flawed father.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When a thriller opens with a long single-take shot, it’s a signal of intent. For a film called Crazxy — the spelling can be triggering until you realise it has something to do with an extra chromosome — this signal is very necessary. The shot starts on an &amp;lsquo;Ethical Dilemma of Surgery’ book, snakes across the posh apartment and follows its inhabitant, Abhimanyu Sood (Sohum Shah), as he leaves with a bag of cash to his garage. Jesper Kyd’s music is a hybrid of an Ennio Morricone spaghetti-western score and an ‘80s Bachchan potboiler. Within the next five minutes, we learn that this hassled man is a doctor, the amount of money is five crores, it’s April Fool’s Day, his angry boss is waiting at the hospital, and Abhimanyu has Haryanvi driving genes (he takes on a rowdy Gurgaon biker to return a middle finger). It’s clear that Crazxy means business. It’s also clear that Crazxy is better than its title.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Sohum Shah filmmaking banner comes with a suitcase, currency notes blowing out of it. Start and Finish come misspelt. It’s a wonky world. Tall, suited-booted surgeon Dr Abhimanyu Sood (Sohum Shah) strides towards his Range Rover, a duffel bag stuffed with cash is stashed in the boot. Rs 5 crore, you soon learn. There’s menace hanging in the air. Inside the car with White Coat calling, hyper and bossy. “I’ll be there on time,” the surgeon assures White Coat. Outside, a wheelie-performing two-wheeler dashes across the Range Rover, the rider cheekily showing a blurred middle finger. Our doctor is hot-headed. Must give it back. Chases the two-wheeler, returns the finger gesture before resuming his drive to God-knows-where. A man with a mask leers at Abhimanyu from the window. Currency notes have been peeping out of the bag in the boot, prompting the mask to leer some more. The scene is set for the unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crazxy movie review: The stuck-behind-a-steering-wheel/closed-phone-booth character, hellbent on saving a loved one from dire consequences, has been used in a few films. In ‘Crazxy’, Sohum Shah plays a surgeon, on track for a crucial meeting, poleaxed by a phone call which changes everything: he needs to rapidly regroup and think on his feet, to prevent calamity befalling a member of his family. At 93 minutes, the film is fashioned as an edge-of-the-seat thriller, and Shah’s Dr Abhimanyu Sood does his best to put metal-to-pedal, while fielding calls from a bunch of increasingly agitated people: ex-wife (voiced by Nimisha Sajayan), current interest (voiced by Shilpa Shukla), boss of his hospital (voiced by Piyush Mishra), and a senior teacher (voiced by Tinnu Anand) at his daughter Vedika’s (Unnati Surana, on screen briefly) school, who is empathetic to her special needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;पहले ‘शिप ऑफ थीसियस’, फिर ‘तुम्बाड़’ और अब यह फिल्म ‘क्रेज़ी’-इतना तो साफ है कि बतौर निर्माता सोहम शाह जो कर रहे हैं उसे एक शब्द में कहा जाए तो वह होगा-दुस्साहस। जब बनाने वाले को दो और दो मिला कर पांच न करने हों, जब उसे टिकट-खिड़की के आंकड़ों की परवाह न हो तो ही वह कुछ हट के वाला सिनेमा बना पाता है। ‘क्रेज़ी’ (Crazxy) इस का ताज़ा उदाहरण है। किसी को पांच करोड़ रुपए देने जा रहे डॉक्टर अभिमन्यु सूद को फोन आता है कि उसकी बेटी किडनैप कर ली गई है और फिरौती की रकम है-पूरे पांच करोड़। वही बेटी जिसे अभिमन्यु ने कभी जी भर कर निहारा तो दूर, स्वीकारा तक नहीं। वही बेटी जो अभिमन्यु की तलाकशुदा पत्नी के पास रहती है। इधर अभिमन्यु की ज़िंदगी दांव पर है। उधर उसकी तलाकशुदा पत्नी अपनी बेटी को बचाने के लिए मिन्नतें कर रही है। वहीं उसकी प्रेमिका उसे इस झमेले से दूर रहने को उकसा रही है। लेकिन इस चक्रव्यूह में फंस चुका अभिमन्यु तय करता है कि वह अब भेजे की नहीं सुनेगा क्योंकि भेजे की सुनेगा तो…!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
