      <description>&lt;p&gt;The blood begins to flow even before the first scene in Marco. For a film about a bastard son avenging the murder of his adopted brother, itâ€™s appropriate for even the opening credits to show his family tree in the form of a (literal) bloodline, as blood flows from one generation to next. Haneef Adeni, after the unwatchable comedy Ramachandra Boss &amp;amp; Co, returns home to a world he is most familiar with, in Marco. All his obsessions return too, including the Biblical references, Christian symbolism, Malayali men dressed for black tie events in peak summer, and the cringiest of English dialogues that are too lethal even for TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
