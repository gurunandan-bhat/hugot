      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a certain space defines your identity and you donâ€™t know it until that space is&#xA;taken away from you. Indrani directed Bengali film Chhaad tells you about a school teacher,&#xA;a dormant artist Mitra/ Paoli Dam, who loves to spend her evenings on her building terrace. It&#xA;is here she befriends her niece and a few kids who come up to fly kites. She attends school in&#xA;the morning post her daily chores as a daughter-in-law of a joint family, Mitra looks forward&#xA;to watering the plants on the terrace of their dilapidated building.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
