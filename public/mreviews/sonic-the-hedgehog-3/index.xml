      <description>&lt;p&gt;After two successful releases, the series is nowhere close to its end and isn’t bad. Featuring an ensemble cast of Jim Carrey, Keanu Reeves, Idris Elba and many more the film does justice for its young and adult audience. The makers manage to strike an almost balance between entertaining both of its audiences. Unlike many sequels, this one stays true to its core and explores a more chaotic version of Eggman, taking it to the next level. The writing and performances keep the films from falling into the same trap as all other sequels. The makers don’t waste time setting the story or the gap between the films. Just as the family of three aliens and two humans is celebrating Sonic’s Earth Birthday another catastrophe befalls their world. On the other side of their world, another alien is wreaking havoc. A sinister and darker version of Sonic called Shadow has broken out of a 50-year-old prison and is out for revenge. As Sonic, Tails and Knuckles begin to investigate they wonder if they know the full truth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
