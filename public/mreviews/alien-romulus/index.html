        <p>The Alien franchise has been active for over four decades now, starting from 1979, and has seen at least three big names associated with it as directors. Ridley Scott started it all as a director followed by James Cameron and then David Fincher made the third installment in 1992. The subsequent three films were underwhelming even though Scott returned as the director for the last two films.</p>
<p>Alien: Romulus is the seventh film in the franchise (not counting the two crossover films) and brings back memories of the first two films, in a good way. Directed by Fede Alvarez (of Don’t Breathe and the new Evil Dead fame), Romulus sticks to the basics without complicating the plot too much. It reminds us of the thrills and chills that Scott and Cameron delivered in the first two films and makes up for these elements that were sorely missing in Prometheus and Covenant. Those last two films had too much talk and little action. But Alvarez is clear about the tone and direction in which he wants to take Romulus – the mantra is to keep it simple.</p>
